Generally ok. But I faced two issues. One is range you cannot get more than 80km in eco mode. Also there is minimum 100w drop in power in idle condition per day. I faced one serious problem that the scooter fell on my leg in stationary condition with side stand on. Design and material of stand is very bad. It can fall any time. Also range reduces with different road conditions. Think twice before purchase,-3
"This was a bad scooter, like a degraded 450X made into a long scooter and it doesnâ€™t seem so practical too, better stick with petrol scooters for now ðŸ˜Š",-2
"I bought the Ritza in January 2025, and now I regret my decision.  

**Issues:**  
- The seat hinge is very weak and does not justify the scooter's cost.  
- The suspension is extremely stiff, making rides uncomfortable, especially on bad roads.  
- When riding uphill, the speed naturally decreases, but it does not recover even on flat terrain. The scooter remains slow until it is restarted.  
- The software has several lags. In Smart Echo mode, the speed sometimes exceeds 60 km/h, while at other times, it struggles to go beyond 30 km/h.  
- In Zip mode, the scooter occasionally fails to cross 40 km/h.  
- The dashboard does not display an accurate speed reading. The speed sometimes drops or increases suddenly without any real change in the scooterâ€™s movement.  
- The key knob feels like a cheap toyâ€”flimsy and overly loose.  
- The joystick is not very responsive; you have to press multiple times to open the menu.  
- Bluetooth does not stay off. Even after turning it off, it automatically turns on every time the scooter is restarted.  
- The seat does not close properly and remains loose. While riding, it makes a constant rattling (""gud gud"") noise on the road.  

I deeply regret buying this scooter. Please do not make the same mistake.",-2
"I have been using the rizta top end model for almost 4k kms now. There are 2 serious issues I have had so far. 
1. Sometimes when I am parking the vehicle in reverse mode , the software glitches and turns off the reverse mode automatically. This happens within the span of 1 second. I almost ended up getting into the road and driving perpendicular to the traffic. 

2. There are times when the display freezes randomly. It can happen anytime and anywhere. The problem that occurs to me is I cannot change the driving modes at that time. And I am unaware of the display freeze so when I try to overtake any vehicle I shift from eco to zip mode but because I am still in eco mode I end up going parallel to the vehicle and into the incoming traffic. 

Everything else is fine but these 2 issues are a huge huge safety hazard. I contact ather and informed them multiple times , I have also had them repeatedly service it but the problem still exists. The service team from ather have been giving their best effort to fix it. I have also spoken with other rizta owners. They don't seem to noitce anything like this yet. 

(FYI : the reverse mode glitch happened twice and the display freeze glitch happened many times)",-2
Sabre bada issue aap hn kyu ki ye issues koi bade issues nhi hnðŸ˜… service ather ki top notch h jbse liya h best h,-2
"MISLEADING Don't buy Rizta:
Ather Paywalls safety and fundamental functionality in pro pack:

Safety features that are ""optional and paid"": 
SkidControl TM 
AutoHoldTM
Auto Indicator Cut-off
Emergency Stop Signal
FallSafeTM
Find My Scooter
Tow & Theft Notifications

Fundamental ""optional & paid features"":
SmartEcoTM Mode
Dashboard - Auto Brightness
Real-time Charge Status

This is such a anti-consumer business strategy, especially for ""Family scooter"", you don't make safety features optional and paid in family bike. And if you do then better everyone should only talk about scooter price with propack included always. Rizta without propack is tier 3 chinese whitelabled entry level scooter at best, even if I buy 1.45L ex-showroom worth of top variant I have to shell 20k more on the safety and fundamental features. 
Now 1.72L for a family scooter? No wonder why Activa & Jupiters are still selling, no wonder why my F77 suddenly doesn't sound that expensive comparatively, for ammount of bike I'm getting. Such a sad state of affairs.",-1
"Nothing new to know!
A review from ZigWheels should be zestier than run-of-the-mill stuff!

BTW, hey, buddy! Talk a bit slowly and steadily. Don't lump the words into luddoos and roll them out!",-1
"Are you facing any issues with gaining pickup even at full throttle?
Sometimes the scooter goes upto even 60kmph in smart eco and sometimes struggles to gain pickup at full throttle (hardly goes to 20 to 30kmph).",-1
"I was asking for a suggestion with my colleagues to which should I go with. One of them said go with aethar. But everyone on my family have range anxiety. I jsut said one thing the Activa which I'm using is almost 10 years old and no issue till yet. Will the aethar last for for 10 years? I don't think so. I'm only concerned about the battery becoming less effective and with time it will become more frustrating regarding the range it will offer. 

Hell no.",-1
Motor sound is very annoying and build quality is poor its not Ather Quality.,-1
