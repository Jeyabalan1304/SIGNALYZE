reddit,2025-10-12T16:30:06,No-man_show,"My point with accessories and insurance was from self perspective after owning a vehicle over 1 year and getting another one this year .
Buying insurance from Dealership won't do any good as they have customized plans and their commissions added .
I went with my research and bought Acko last year which helped in 2 accidental damages worth more than 20k together .
Dealership were giving me same coverage like the package at around 9.5k where I got it under 6.9k using Amazon pay gift cards and used Amazon pay while paying to insurance.
Last year dealership recommended me Godigit ,this year they pushed for Tata Aig , reason - Better commission for them .
So never buy an insurance based on suggestions from dealership.If you want a true picture ,visit service centre , they will tell you who pays and actually don't keep them hanged during reimbursement claims .
About safety gears , It costed me about 3.5 including installation but got the entire body protected with additional structure , which helped me in one accident , same when I compared with brand accessory was of poor quality and could have costed more .
I initially wanted to get foot rest but dealership didn't had the stock for more than 3 months and they never bothered to revert when requested them.
So the money you are saving you can add to get better safety gears for protection of you and your vehicle .

I don't know where you're based, but I assume your city also has pothole filled roads, make sure to test drive on the worst roads for a good 15-20 mins. This will give you an idea of comfort. Rizta might give you better comfort for a 30 km ride in heavy traffic, but this is purely up to your personal preference.

I have to do 4 trips of 10 km each everyday through little to no traffic and went with Ather 450x 3.9kW. The fuel expense was burning a hole in my pocket and it was heartbreaking to see my 3rd most largest expense after rent and food was fuel.

I've barely spent 40 Rs. in charging cost and already travelled 250+ km on the Ather. Check out your local EV charging points whether Ather grid or other plug and pay outlets. Get an idea if they're working, being maintained, and if you have plenty of options around. Same for your college locality. Always plan ahead as a worst case scenario backup. If you feel you're covered on the charging points front, you can explore the EV option.

I absolutely love the ride on the Ather and have no regrets over this model. It's so light that my sister and my SO both enjoy it and say it's easy to handle. My sister is now planning to get the same model for herself.

Regardless of what you go with, safe travels and enjoy!",https://reddit.com/r/ATHERENERGY/comments/1o3qxlq/should_i_consider_ather_over_a_petrol_scooter/niwynpf/,1,positive,0.9682,Product,Battery & Charging,Battery mention

I confronted the agent from the company and she told me it is mandatory and she can’t remove or add it as it is mandatory by law and I simply requested to rectify by endorsement and they denied even her manager was telling me it is mandatory by law when I said no I know the that this is not mandatory I have read the guidelines and company policies then he started telling it just got mandatory from this year itself.

Let me be absolutely clear for you and for everyone else reading this:

A **Voluntary Deductible is NOT, and has never been, mandatory by law.**

This is a tactic used by some agents to lower the premium quote and make it look more attractive. They add a voluntary deductible without informing the customer, and what you experienced – the agent and even the manager lying about it – is a classic example of mis-selling. It is completely unethical.

You have done the absolute right thing by raising a grievance on the IRDAI portal. That is the most powerful step you can take.

One more thing to check immediately: Since it's a new policy, you should have a **15-day ""free-look"" period** from the date you received the policy documents. If you are still within this period, you can cancel the policy and get a full refund, no questions asked. I would strongly suggest you check the date and act on this if you can.

reddit,2025-10-08T16:07:46,iam_man_ish,"Here’s the inside scoop that many don't know, based on what happens during actual claims. You're right to be skeptical about specific ""EV covers"" for two-wheelers. The main issue is salvage value.

Think about it, just like you said: if the battery on an Ather is severely damaged, what's the real value left in the rest of the scooter? Almost nothing.

Because of this, if there's major damage to the battery or motor, the repair cost can easily be more than 75% of the scooter's value. When that happens, the insurance company will declare it a ""total loss"".

This is exactly where the Return to Invoice (RTI) add-on becomes the real hero.

If your scooter is declared a total loss (which is very likely after major battery damage), the RTI add-on ensures you get back the full original on-road price you paid. Not just the current market value (IDV).

So, a much safer strategy for a new scooter isn't hunting for a specific battery cover, but making sure you have a solid Return to Invoice (RTI) add-on. It's the cleanest and most effective way to protect your investment.",https://reddit.com/r/ATHERENERGY/comments/1o1coei/getting_the_right_insurance_for_your_ather_a/nifyh7j/,4,positive,0.9519,Product,Battery & Charging,Battery mention

reddit,2025-10-09T15:54:41,iam_man_ish,"Thats a major point of confusion for many EV owners after these Battery warranty from the Brand.

The simplest way to think about it is: **Insurance is for ACCIDENTS. Warranty is for PERFORMANCE & DEFECTS.**

Let me break it down based on your question:

1. **Your Insurance (Return to Invoice and Battery Protect):** This covers your scooter from sudden, unforeseen events. The Battery Protect add-on would help if your battery gets damaged in a **crash, a flood, or a fire**. If the damage is so severe that the scooter is a ""total loss,"" the RTI add-on would get you the full invoice value back. It will **not** cover the battery if its health just drops over time from normal usage.
2. **Ather's Warranty (the 'eight seventy' plan):** This is the manufacturer's promise about the product's quality and performance. If your battery health drops below 70% from normal charging and use within the warranty period, **this is a warranty issue**. Ather is responsible for replacing it, not the insurance company.

So, to answer your question directly: No, insurance will absolutely not cover the battery replacement if its health drops below 70%. You would still need the Ather warranty for that kind of performance-related issue.

You need both, as they protect you from completely different kinds of problems. It's like having health insurance to cover a broken leg (an accident) vs. the manufacturer's warranty on your phone if its screen stops working on its own (a defect).

Hope that makes it crystal clear!",https://reddit.com/r/ATHERENERGY/comments/1o1coei/getting_the_right_insurance_for_your_ather_a/nim5x7f/,1,negative,-0.3,Product,Battery & Charging,Battery mention

When I arrived, I was told that the TPMS could only be installed after the factory mode was removed. I was asked to wait for about 30-60 minutes and to check with the salesperson, which I appreciated. Luckily, it was resolved within 40 minutes. I was then advised to pick up the vehicle in the evening. While the process was a bit slow initially, I appreciate the staff’s efforts to resolve everything once I followed up.

Look, The Rizta is an amazing EV, hands down. The first time i experienced Zip mode, it blew me away. Even today when the signal turns green, it zips ahead in an instant.

Talking about Service, it obviously depends on your location, however in my experience it has been so far amazing. The Staff is friendly and very welcoming.

Now, coming to the point of 8 Years Battery warranty. You need to understand that the stock price gets you 3 years. You have to upgrade to the pro pack to get it upto 5 years and then you unlock the 8 year tier. You cannot go to the 8 year mark without getting the pro pack. So cost is going to be a consideration. Especially if you compare to traditional ICE scooters, the 8 year tier is going to set you back by a good amount.

I personally own 3 Athers, 2 of which have the 8 year warranty. It is a no brainer if you value comfort and top notch features that wont let you down.

When i brought my rizta sometime back, i had a fixed idea. I needed Magic Twist and Skid control. I almost never need Navigation and fancy display, but the Z is the only option if you need Magic Twist and Skid Control, so i got the Z.

If you feel that you can do without maps and the ""Z"" feature set, then go for the S with 159 IDC.

And dont drive the scooter with only cost savings in mind. Many people emphasize so much on range and cost mathematics that they simply dont enjoy the upgrade that their ride got. Yes, it is cheaper. But more importantly, it is a lot better quality wise.

reddit,2025-10-06T17:13:00,Hare_97,"Brother, E20 affects mostly older (non E20 vehicles). 

As for the points he has missed:
- Service people might be friendly, but their technical knowledge can be very poor depending on the centre and area.
- It caused a limp mode issue in the first week of ownership to me, never again (lots of people have this experience).
- In the rain, it is highly reliable but would suggest you to immediately swap those MRF tyres, their grip is completely absurd. CEAT is my family choice and from recent posts, Michelin is great. If you stick to MRF, the road grip confidence drops a ton with pillion or on less grippy roads.
- Ather battery and motor are great but everything except that has gone through a lot of quality downgrades. The plastic can be easily damaged and if you ride in bumpy roads...oh well.
- The biggest natural enemy is rats..they got my wires twice.
- Other is coneset issue, even after repair it doesn't go away (one 20k Km user reported it has been a recurring for him as well)
- The main point is charging. If you have even a single inconvenience for charging system setup, please avoid the EV sector. Many apartment or flat users get EV and then are always fighting for bills and permissions. Leaving your system in the open has been a pain as well.

Edit: If you expose it to too much rain, headlight fogging and handle stiffness can also happen. Your rear section will always be full of mud.

Regarding Range, if i go drive in one go, i am able to consistently get 115-120 kms

In case of short multiple rides, my range is around 80-85 kms. Driving sty;le matters a lot, and honestly it is really tempting to switch to the zip mode permanently.

So when you want to overtake and you know you can manage it at that limited speed , you have control of the situation. 
The smart eco has more range ( 10 -15 kms ) but its throttle and top speed are variables. They depend on certain conditions which you don't know exactly. Initially you will get a good boost and after a few kms of driving the throttle is slowly reduced to save range. The problem lies in the fact that the throttle is so slow that to get from 20 to 40 kmph speed it takes 15 seconds. Enough to cause trouble. On a good day the smart eco will totally behave like zip mode and I won't even notice the throttle drop anywhere in my 34 km journey and on random days the throttle will nearly get me into an accident .

Second is network. Ather uses a lot, I mean a lot of battery just to stay connected to network. It can drain 10% overnight if you live in a very poor network area. It's normally 2-3% otherwise.

Last would be weight on scooter, your driving habits and tyre pressure.

Now coming to Ather fault:
- MRF tyres lose a lot of air pressure due to its structure, get them changed if necessary
- New Atherstack has made several scooters range drop by 10-20%
- Sometimes front brakes keep pressing, an old issue which still creeps in making range lower. You have get those repaired.

If u let it coast / regen by itself it will load back in and you will be in sports mode for few seconds until u use the brakes.

Smart Eco is literally making you use more regen by cutting off excessive torque and if u want the torque back the only way is to let it regen by not using brakes.


What i do when i drive in smart eco is i keep the power band very low like 10-20% throttle max & use regen all the time.
So the power stays on for a very long time although the acceleration is pretty slow but it will have instant torque when needed!

I would suggest everyone to use sports or warp mode 100% of the time and use less throttle, it will give you same or more range than smart eco + you have enough power whenever needed just incase of emergency.",https://reddit.com/r/ATHERENERGY/comments/1nwtsj7/smarteco_colour_change_while_driving/nhjgdbq/,2,positive,0.7465,Product,Battery & Charging,Range mention

reddit,2025-10-13T18:14:19,TemuPacemaker,"BMW i4 or Merc CLA?

I'll skip all the standard questions because I have a good idea of what I want and have done the research. It basically comes down to these two (or a base short-range A6, but that seems like it would be worse in every way other than maybe isolation, which isn't something I even want anyway).

Within the budget I can get an eDrive40 with ///M adaptive steering and suspension, ACC with stop & go, and parking assist with 360 cameras. White free paint. The CLA, on the other hand, could be an almost maxed out 350 4matic, sans the cosmetic AMG package or the stupid passenger screen.

I'm having a hard time deciding between these two. Normally I'd think myself as more of an ""ultimate driving machine guy"" but this is a giant heavy EV that I won't track, so does that really matter? I tested an i4 m50 and the CLA 350 a few weeks apart, and while the BMW did feel a bit faster, it wasn't *that* much (\~3.7 to 100km vs 4.6s for CLA, eDrive40 would be slower), I couldn't say the suspension and steering were night and day without driving them back to back. I'd also need to get stickier tires to get more out of them, thus ruining the range.

**Pros I4**

* Sportier steering/suspension?
* Design (other than grille, but CLA isn't better)
* Interior design and UX, some real buttons
* Quieter
* Liftback
* Normal roof

**Pros CLA**

* Quicker
* Longer range
* Faster charging
* More gadgets

Has anyone tried both? Any things to consider?

E: I'm aware the CLA doesn't support 400V charging but seems like it should be ok here. Neither support V2L unfortunately but I'll live with that.

I’m after something sporty/coupe-style but still roomy (compact SUV is fine, but I would prefer a sporty sedan or liftback) with a premium interior.

On my shortlist right now:

Volvo ES90
Audi S6 Sportback
Polestar 4 (I seriously love the Polestar 5, but it’s out of budget with the current price tag)
I’ve never owned a Volvo or PS, so here are a few things I’m really curious about:

How do they “feel” compared to Audi, in handling, ride quality, interior quality, responsiveness, refinement?
Do Volvo or PS models offer a feature like Audi’s adaptive pilot assist that automatically adjusts to speed limits? I really like this on my Audi and use it daily. I did some research and sounds like Polestar has such feature but not Volvo EV models, which is confusing (e.g., XC90 documentation mentions ASL, but not ES90…)

https://insideevs.com/news/775704/electric-pickup-sales-us-q3-2025/  
> Despite the Tesla Cybertruck’s huge sales drop in Q3, the Rivian R1T finished dead last.   
> 
> The best-selling electric truck in America in the third quarter was the Ford F-150 Lightning, with 10,005 units sold, a healthy 39.7% year-over-year increase. From the beginning of the year, the blue oval automaker sold 23,024 Lightnings stateside, according to Cox Automotive, a modest 1% increase over last year.
> 
> The Tesla Cybertruck finished the quarter in second place, with 5,385 units sold, a dramatic 62.2% drop year-over-year. From January through September, Tesla sold 16,097 Cybertrucks, a 38% decrease compared to the same period last year.
> 
> Hot on the heels of the controversial angular pickup is the GMC Hummer EV. Granted, we don’t know for sure how many pickup models were sold, as Cox Automotive’s data bundles pickups and SUVs. Together, the two electric behemoths sold 5,246 units in the previous quarter, an increase of 21.9% over last year. From the beginning of the year, 13,233 units found new homes, a 48.7% increase over 2024.
> 
> Fourth place goes to the Chevrolet Silverado EV, which nearly doubled its sales numbers compared to last year. In Q3, the Silverado EV sold 3,940 units, up 97.5% year-over-year. From January to September, 9,370 trucks were sold, a 78.6% increase from last year.
> 
> The technically similar GMC Sierra EV is close behind, with 3,374 units finding new customers in the third quarter. The Sierra EV had a late start last year, which means its sales increased by a whopping 771.8% in Q3 2025. Year-to-date, 6,147 units were sold.
> 
> The Rivian R1T is currently the worst-selling electric pickup in America. In the previous quarter, the EV startup sold 2,378 pickups, a decent increase of 13.1% over last year, but it wasn’t enough to help it get ahead of any of its competitors. The same goes for the R1T’s year-to-date sales performance, with 5,857 EVs finding new homes, a decrease of 32.5% versus last year, when Rivian sold 8,673 R1Ts from January through September.

reddit,2025-10-14T15:59:42,robotcoke,"We absolutely DO want big electric trucks. 

The Ford F-150 has been the best selling vehicle in the US for 47 years in a row and counting. The Chevy Silverado/GMC Sierra and Dodge Ram are always close behind and still in the top 5. Big trucks are BY FAR the best selling vehicles in America, for around 50 years in a row and counting. 

The reason electric trucks aren't selling that well is because 
1: They cost an arm and a leg.  
2: Most of them don't have enough range.  
3: They are all crew cabs.  
4: None of them can handle a 5th wheel or a cabover camper.  

There are little nuances that bend these statements - like the Silverado EV has enough range but it has a weird bed shape that standard shells won't fit and it costs around $100K. The F-150 Lightning has a standard bed that a lot of shells are available for, but doesn't have the range to go on a far away camping trip without spending half the time (hyperbole) charging. 

Basically, the EV trucks on the market right now targeted one specific type of user. Everyone on reddit said, ""Nobody uses their truck as a truck anyway. They only get used for driving to the grocery store with the kids in the back seat."" And apparently the auto execs bought into that nonsense. So all the EV trucks are perfectly designed for that use case. Everyone that wants an EV and uses a truck for that purpose is who they are being marketed to. 

People who want to pull a 5th wheel from coast to coast, or want to be able to use their cabover camper that they spent $20K on and currently use with their diesel truck, or they don't drive kids to the grocery store in their truck and they just want an extended cab and not a full crew cab, etc, etc. Those people don't have an option right now. It's not that they don't want an electric truck, it's that none of the electric trucks on the market can do these things. And if you're going to fork out around $100K for a truck, you don't want to have any compromises. Especially if you already have a diesel truck that does all of this and you spent $80K on a 5th wheel trailer that you use regularly.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o6hest/it_turns_out_that_americans_dont_really_want_big/njgu3n2/,1,positive,0.9023,Product,Battery & Charging,Range mention

I’m guessing that Ford is going to come out with a plug in hybrid based on the 2.7L ecoboost (or possibly a small diesel) with a 50-100kwh pack that will answer a lot of people’s prayers for more efficiency towing. The current 3.5L powerboost non-plug in hybrid is okay but doesn’t get great mileage towing and has a smaller gas tank on the light duty frame, and thus has smallish payload.

reddit,2025-10-14T05:46:42,ApprehensiveSize7662," There’s a comforting story that oil bulls like to tell themselves to stave off worries about the future: While the privileged few in Europe and California might have lost their minds over electric vehicles, billions of drivers in the Global South are readying themselves to provide the next wave of petroleum demand.
 
Those who believe this might want to have a look at the cars and two-wheelers that people are actually buying right now. Far from trailing the rich world in their enthusiasm for battery cars, developing nations are surging ahead.
 
China (where plug-in vehicles have nearly half the market) gets most of the attention, but neighboring Vietnam isn’t far behind: Pure-play EV-maker VinFast Auto Ltd. accounted for more than a third of car sales in the first half of this year. Turkey’s 13 per cent sales share for fully electric vehicles in the first quarter was about double the penetration rate in Spain and Australia, according to a survey by Strategy&. In Indonesia, the share was about the same as in the US, at 7.4 per cent. In Malaysia, it was 8.6 per cent in the first half.
 
charts
 
 
Those countries all have legacy car industries still pumping out internal combustion engines. Things are moving even faster in nations wholly dependent on imports. More than three-quarters of the value of vehicles brought into Nepal, Sri Lanka and Djibouti last year was purely electric. Import shares in Ethiopia and Laos were 40 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. Plug-in sales increased by 60 per cent in developing countries as a whole in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

 As with the wave of EVs taking over the Gulf’s oil producers, it’s a sign of a world switching to electric mobility with breathtaking speed. The pace of the change makes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which expects developing economies’ oil consumption to increase by half by 2050, look deluded. 
 
It’s not impossible this rapid electrification will slow down. EV buyers in emerging markets over the past few years have been encouraged by a range of exemptions from import tariffs, licenses and sales taxes. These subsidies may be removed as local markets mature.
 
charts
 
That’s a thin reed on which to base hopes of a gasoline resurgence, though. In major emerging markets, battery cars were already around price parity with conventional ones last year (in Thailand, they were cheaper). Falling battery costs and rising volumes have since driven down the price of market-leading Chinese EVs by another 10 per cent, while a weaker US dollar has improved purchasing power in many countries.
 
Combined with the lower ownership costs of EVs — a major consideration in emerging markets, where a larger share of vehicles are used as taxis and to transport goods, rather than as private cars — that’s likely to keep battery automobiles competitive with conventional ones, even without government support.
 
Policymakers are also likely to extend such incentives for purely macroeconomic reasons. In India and Pakistan, oil and gas account for as much as a third of the total import bill, compared to around 10 per cent in the US and European Union. That makes the economy unusually vulnerable to swings in the price of crude, and ensures that money spent on transport fuel is enriching other countries, rather than being recycled through domestic supply chains where it can enhance economic growth. Switching half of India’s car fleet to electricity — still a far-off ambition, to be sure — would be sufficient to eliminate the country’s persistent current account deficit, according to one 2022 study.
 
charts
 
Conventional cars will still be guzzling gas for years after they disappear from dealers’ lots. BloombergNEF doesn’t expect the fleet of plug-free cars to peak until 2028. That will provide an ongoing market for gasoline and diesel — but it’s still a declining one. By 2030, BloombergNEF forecasts EVs will be displacing about 5.3 million barrels of oil a day, equivalent to about a 10th of all road fuel consumed globally at present.
 
The stronger argument for the resilience of road fuel at this point isn’t that emerging markets are going to start using more of it. It’s clear this battle is already being lost. Instead, it’s that rich countries have raised tariff barriers, bungled charger rollouts, and loosened fuel-economy rules to the point where they’ve sabotaged their own transition plans. 
 
That’s giving incumbent carmakers a chance to eke a few more years out of their obsolete businesses, while competitors in the Global South seize the technological lead. Most of the world is already taking advantage of cleaner, cheaper road transportation. By the time developed countries realize how far they’ve fallen behind, it will be too late to catch up.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o67c7a/ev_adoption_surges_in_developing_nations/njejkoj/,34,positive,0.9911,Product,Battery & Charging,Fast charging praised

https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-2025

Current oil consumption is ~101 mb/d.  it will continue to grow, but at a slower rate than previously.

“Global oil demand is forecast to rise by 2.5 mb/d from 2024 to 2030, reaching a plateau around 105.5 mb/d by the end of the decade. However, annual growth slows from roughly 700 kb/d in 2025 and 2026 to just a trickle over the next several years, with a small decline expected in 2030, based on today’s policy settings and market trends. This is driven by below-trend economic growth, weighed down by global trade tensions and fiscal imbalances, and the accelerating substitution away from oil in the transport and power generation sectors.

Despite some recent headwinds, global electric car sales have continued their remarkable growth trajectory. They exceeded 17 million in 2024 and are expected to surpass 20 million in 2025, representing around one-quarter of all cars sold, according to the IEA’s Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2025. This analysis shows that EVs are set to displace 5.4 mb/d of global oil demand by the end of the decade. Substitution away from oil will also feature prominently in power generation during the forecast period – particularly in Saudi Arabia, where displacement of oil burning by natural gas and renewables drives the single largest decline in oil demand for any country through 2030.”

75% of vehicles sold in 2025 worldwide will be ICE powered.  So no, EVs will not cause oil to disappear.

So, in simple terms, there’s 5% less oil being produced every year.  Unless there continuing investment to sustain that production or develop new reserves, supply falls.  

In simple terms, if demand falls at the same rate as supply falls, the price stays the same.  If there’s a slight mismatch (there always is, which is why the price of oil fluctuates), the price falls if too much supply and rises if there’s too much demand.  

So, there won’t be a $30 scenario, because producers won’t invest the money to keep production at that level.  Fields with high production costs get temporarily shut in when the price gets too low.

There will be a time when physical production declines substantially.  It’s been forecast since the 1950s.  But the takeaway point is that oil will be with us for many decades to come.

reddit,2025-10-14T00:15:24,Mac-Tyson,"Last year over 40% of new vehicles sold were priced over 50K so the demand is there. Now for why there is a lot of people with a lot of money in the US but it’s more from our culture of being a finance society. People feel like if they can afford the monthly payment then they can afford the vehicle. Most financial advisors advise not buying a vehicle that is over 50% of your income. But people routinely do since the monthly payments aren’t 50% of your monthly earnings. 

So people are routinely buying more expensive new cars and the people who can’t afford to buy new buy used. Which has also added to why vehicles have gotten so expensive since the market feels that if they make an affordable sub-35K vehicle people are going to choose a relatively low mileage vehicle that is larger and/or have more features. But then also automakers have needed to continually made vehicles larger and more full of features to justify people buying new instead of buying the older model. Where once luxury features are now standard in economy vehicles. If an automaker makes an affordable vehicle it’s usually just a loss leader to make other vehicles in their lineup more attractive (ex: Chevy Trax). 

Now in the world of EVs we are starting the beginning of a counter wave for affordable EV’s starting with the 2026 Nissan Leaf, 2027 Chevy Bolt, 2027 Ford Ranchero (unconfirmed named), and 2027 Slate Truck. This is happening since the industry is realizing that too much of the population is starting to get priced out of new vehicles especially when it comes to EVs. It’s why Jim Farley says we need to get over our range anxiety as a nation. Since if we are going to produce profitable affordable BEV’s we can’t just continue sticking big batteries into large vehicles. But if this wave of affordable EVs don’t at least meet the low sales expectations (from the legacy manufacturers) because everyone is just buying a used Tesla, Hyundai, etc instead than we will likely see this cycle continue.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o5z8gy/us_average_new_car_price_tops_50k_for_the_first/njd6qjz/,7,positive,0.402,Product,Battery & Charging,Range mention

reddit,2025-10-14T00:35:18,Mac-Tyson,"If we want average Car Prices to go down we need to be encouraging buying the affordable new options on the market over used. Currently the market is hesitant to make vehicles under 30k outside of loss leaders because they feel that if they make an under 30k vehicle, people are just going to buy a relatively low mileage used vehicle that is larger and/or has more features. It’s why $35k is considered the new “affordable” price for new vehicle.

I remember seeing video where someone felt like things like the Hummer EV were increasing EV Prices. I disagree if the Hummer EV doesn’t sell well GM will just assume that people weren’t interested in that product. Since it’s a niche flagship for GMC anyways. Right now the market is geared towards under 50K EVs. As long as people keep buying those vehicles the market will keep making them. But there is an upcoming potential wave of affordable BEV’s with the 2026 Nissan Leaf, 2027 Chevy Bolt, 2027 Ford Ranchero (unconfirmed name), and 2027 Slate Truck.

reddit,2025-10-14T02:55:02,FencyMcFenceFace,"I don't see the ""affordable EV"" wave as anything more than meeting a price point: the large EVs either end up much more expensive than the equivalent ICE with worse range, or having features/trims that are mediocre compared to what you can get in an equivalent ICE, also with worse range. Gas is cheap so there just isn't much of an appeal to people who don't care about EV.

Expectations are much lower on a budget car, so features and trim are less important, efficiency/aerodynamics is easier so you can get out of the battery for less cost, and the cost difference isn't nearly as extremely as the larger cars, so you can appeal to budget-minded/commuter types.

Unfortunately I just don't see a mass appeal for this: americans just overwhelmingly don't like these cars unless gas prices are high. They don't sell well.

Also they can't tell between a shiny new car and a shiny used car with problems, so for peace of mind they buy new when able.

We bought a new car in 1999. We still have it but it belongs to our eldest now. We replaced it with a used Kona Electric that has been excellent. We'll prob never buy a new car again.

They ignored the existence of our new (used) EV. It cost alot less than their cars and represents change that they have a hard time accepting. We didn't lecture about EVs, or talk it up - just bought one and quietly started driving it to family events. They are EV blind apparently. The whole situation is fascinating to me.

1. Good safety systems (cameras everywhere, systems tell you if humans are near, and WHERE)
2. Built-in truckbed cover strong enough to stand on (and pretty secure)
3. No need to worry about door dings, etc
4. No worry about frame rust
5. Built-in L-Track the length of the bed
6. Built-in bedliner (people whine about it not being metal, but the whole point is its tough enough to take hits and its sacrificial)
7. Built in lighting the length of the bed
8. truckbed is over 4ft wide its entire length
9. variable height means when you park it can drop low enough for an ""80 year old gradma"" to get in safely, but go high enough to get through some seriously bad roads
10. Decent energy consumption if you're not trying to punch a hole in the air.
11. Both 110 & 220v in the bed, enough power to rescue another EV if needed.
12. Handles well in tighter spaces (compared with other extended cab 6ft bed trucks)
13. Rear seats fold up, giving you something like 2ft lengthwise of cabin storage if you need it (easy to put dining-room chairs in there upright with no finagling)

The EV Silverado and Ford F150 lightening are good too for their own purposes (as I understand it the Silverado is the ""hauling king"", and the F150 in it's $105k trim level is a great work-truck. The CT is actually a little closer to the ground, despite the TRON/Bladerunner aesthetic is more pedestrian aware, turns tighter, etc.. it's a bit more of a swiss army knife than the competition.

I'm curious to see what the final spec looks like for the [Telo](https://www.telotrucks.com/).

1. The test was vertical loading on the tow hitch, not horizontal. Shock loads from potholes and the like are somewhat mitigated by the air-suspension; I don't know by how much but the truck absorbs that kind of thing like it's not even there. 8"" potholes at speed make it shake a little but that's it.

reddit,2025-10-14T13:36:05,tech57,"Long article. Some tidbits,  

> However, while those range and efficiency numbers will be hard for some companies to meet, the world’s strictest battery fire regulations (GB 38031-2025), announced earlier this year, could make it more complicated.
> 
> As of May, only BYD and CATL LFP batteries met the standard.  
> 
> From July 2026 on, all new EVs will need to meet the standard. That isn’t much time and could lead to significant market implications.
> 
> Emissions regulations are also anticipated to become stricter soon with the adoption of China 7 emissions. The previous China 6 was harmonized with Euro 6 emissions. China moved up to stricter China 6B last year in anticipation of planned changes for Euro 7. However, Euro 7 was relaxed from earlier plans due to automaker complaints, leaving China with the strictest emissions in the world. Of note, China has tended to make emissions stricter for both new and existing cars, which could lead to a wave of ICE scrappage. Having the strictest emissions standards in the world become even stricter makes ICE compliance a challenge, shifting the market to electrified vehicles.
> 
> We have become accustomed in the West to many automakers having an adversarial relationship with regulators, often proclaiming that stricter regulations are impossible. Conversely, BYD has a history of working with regulators, often making changes proactively and showing that regulations are possible. Chinese regulators frequently imply that changes are coming, and automakers ignore those hints at their own peril. When you see a sweeping change to BYD product like the Han in a timeline that seems out of place in China (updates traditionally launch in 1Q), there is a good chance that regulatory changes are coming. In addition, rather than reactively responding to regulation, they seem to proactively address anticipated changes, comfortably exceeding them and increasing the performance of premium models to provide a differentiating level of performance on those metrics.
> 
> As such, some consolidation is expected, which the new regulations are likely to accelerate. However, this could also impact established players. SAIC and GM have been losing money on their joint venture and GM still has not become profitable on its own EVs in terms of cost of goods sold (only variable costs, excluding fixed costs). With the joint venture under negotiation for renewal and an inability to sell at a loss, could the changes lead to a GM exit?
> 
> However, if companies retreat from China into protected markets, the reduced scale and competition could negatively impact both long-term business performance and product performance.

Long ago, back when gas cars were far more inefficient, you had towns pop up along roadways simply because people needed places to stop to refuel. You had this a lot more in the west because there were far less people than our east.   Electric cars have sort of followed that same process.  Superchargers have even been placed in most of those towns along the same highways.  Look at Quartzite, Kingman, and Gila Bend in Arizona or a lot of places along what used to be Route 66, but are now along other highways. Arizona still needs a charging stop along US93 between Phoenix and Vegas to make it a little more viable for all EVs, but I'm sure someone will add something around Wikiup at some point.    I'm really surprised Elon hasn't put a charging station in Nothing AZ.  The little gas station there closed like 30 years ago, so the 3 people that lived there left.  😂 

All that to say, a lot of the people in the west charge at home and if you're on a road trip, you're more likely to need a level 3 than a level 2.

(BtW it’s not “Supercharger” unless you are talking ONLY about Tesla chargers.) I don’t understand at all why you would want more level 2 charging. Makes no sense. It takes too long — like 10x as long as a level 3 DCFC Charger. This means you hog the Level 2 charger and no one else can use it for hours and hours and hours. With a level 3 charger a modern EV can be in and out in 20 minutes freeing the charger up for the next vehicle. 

If I need to trickle charge away from home I just use a regular outlet. I always carry my charging cable for this purpose. I have done this at hotels in parking garages, at vacation rental houses, etc. Anywhere there is an outlet i can charge my car overnight. 

Public Level 2 charging is useful for plug in hybrids. I have used them occasionally at hotels but I’m more likely to find a level 3 in the morning before I head out.

Use Plugshare and it will point you to available regular wall outlets you can plug into.

And the people that orbit the conservative political sphere to plant ideas in people's heads to give the political machine votes, money and power. There is alot of money to be earned in the status quo. That's the way our cities function, how our healthcare works, where and how we live, and how we spend our money. There are huge inefficiencies that a certain group of people earn alot of money from. The car/truck/SUV and the suburban lifestyle which requires driving everywhere is a perfect example.  

The ones married to the fossil fuel industry are the ones that either directly or indirectly plant and cultivate the seeds of FUD in the American consumer/voter.   

It has helped the ICEV endure in the face of the arguably better technology of EVs. Sure, if I drove 500+ miles per day through very rural places then an ICE would be the better choice right now. If I was towing heavy loads on the regular, then ICE would be the way. In just about every other situation, an EV is superior IMHO.  

If logic and engineering was the foundation for the choices our society and government makes then everything would be different. Right now things are not allowed to happen too quickly (look up Overton Window on Wikipedia) for one perspective. 

Logic and science (engineering) is not the foundation. It is really profit that sets the direction of our society. Mostly the largest portions going to the people at the top. It doesn't matter what happens to the worker bee, it's about whether the gas station conglomerates will be run out of business. Whether the big landlords will face extinction if we work from home. It'll be about whether churches will be irrelevant in the near future. 

The progressives try new ideas and the conservatives resist change when they notice their profits declining. It doesn't matter if the regular folks benefit from new ideas and reorganizing our societies, it's about the powerful business people losing their profits.

You’re coming at this from a perspective of seeking out charging and that’s something 80+% of EV owners very, VERY rarely do. What 80+% of EV owners actually do is make mental notes of where they can get cheap or free charging and try to make places like that fit into their routine. Sure, a 6kW charger isn’t ever going to write up substantial net profits to the books directly, but it can profit a few dollars a week while incentivizing numerous EV owners to park there while handling their grocery runs etc. and that does add up to fairly substantial profits. Sure, I’m not going to turn off the highway and plug in for 3 hours to avoid paying $30 at the EA station, but that’s a scenario that’s infinitely less common than going to the grocery store and going to the one 2 minutes further away for 20% battery charge that costs nearly the same amount it costs at home (or is totally free) while I grab lunch and go grab some groceries.

The cells I was using were the 26650 cylindrical format harvested from Black and Decker power tools (the DeWalt packs were the gold standard for harvesting). These were A123’s original proven product line from their early days - the ANR26650 cells that came out around 2005-2006. By 2010, that technology was mature and bulletproof.

The 2014 Spark used A123’s later automotive-grade prismatic pouch cells. A completely different format that they were scaling up for EV production. That’s where A123 ran into serious manufacturing quality control issues around 2011-2012, which is what caused the Fisker recall and ultimately sank the company.

So yeah, your observation about the Spark is spot on. The automotive cells were troubled. But those chunky cylindrical cells we were using in the hobby world were from A123’s golden era before they tried to scale up to automotive production. Different cells, different era, very different reliability.

Every minute 1 car comes (and has come). Every car charges on one of the 20 250kW chargers. 

After 20 Minutes every car has charged 83,325 kWh.

They will be expensive. But you are also able to sell way more kwh in the same time!

Charging stations get cheaper the faster you can charge! Like, a HYC400 costs 5 times as much as a HYC50 but is able to provie 8 times as much power! So you are able to sell 8 times as much kWh for only 5 times the price!

There is always a fixed costs per charger which than gets spread over more kW.

These cars have electronic door mechanisms, so you can't open from the outside if it's malfunctioned. They have a mechanical release on the inside but it's different than the regular mechanism so it's easy to get confused in a panic or disoriented right after a crash and not realize you have to use it, especially if it's not something you ever used before.



These kinds of door mechanisms should be banned, if I'm being honest. These are just unnecessary vanity features that are going to kill people.

reddit,2025-10-14T09:13:45,Energia91,"I own an (almost) 700bhp, 3-ton EV SUV. It's my very first car in China (I'm a foreigner who lives/works here). And its specification has little to no bearing on its road tax whatsoever. It has some bearing on insurance, but very little. Whether the vehicle is an EV or not has a much higher bearing. 

It cost me just 6700 rmb to insure the car from Pingan Bank. For comparison, my brother's first car (2006 IS250 lol) cost him £1800 in the UK (my home country). Two years later, despite no claims/accidents, they had the cheek to charge him £2800 for a 2018 BMW 440i Gran Coupe. 

Even as a first car, my SUV is incredibly easy to drive in its default drive mode (Eco). Everyone told me a 700bhp 3-ton SUV is a bad idea as a first car, but I think it's much easier to drive than the 70bhp (probably) VW Lavida I used to pass my Chinese driving test. I think most people pootle around in eco mode to save battery for the regular commute. I haven't tried the sports mode yet, which calibrates the power/torque curve to give you instant power. 

In retrospect, I think the 280PS Japanese cap did some harm to the Japanese auto industry. Japanese sports/luxury cars became less competitive as a result. They were fighting with one hand behind their backs. 280ps was competitive in the early to mid-90s. But the rest of the industry moved ahead, while Japan stagnated. Present day, I think it's fair to say Japan makes the most underpowered (comparatively) cars for their market segment. It's just not appealing to luxury/performance orientated buyers.   
  
It's easy to extract more power out of an engine/motor. But much harder to make a reliable, usable (for daily use), dependable car with high power outputs.   
  
When you make high-power output cars mainstream, it improves the technology much faster through scalable results. I think auto regulators in China know this well and have no plans as of now to limit technological progress. So BYD can sell you a Toyota Camry competitor with 1100bhp, and 192mph top speed lmao (HAN-L).",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o5mwxz/xiaomi_su7_ultra_catches_fire_in_accident/njf3pue/,1,positive,0.9794,Product,Battery & Charging,Fast charging praised

The wheelwells are longer but not as tall, if you're trying to maximize passenger room you want lower (& narrower) wheelwells because the rearmost seats are typically packaged over/at the rear wheelwells. This is the reason why minivans all look the way they do, they use small wheels with bodies hanging low to convert as much of their footprint into interior room as possible. If you have two sets of even smaller wheels you can boost that effect further. Lower wheelwells can give a lower load floor too, semi-trucks use a bunch of trailer wheels instead of huge tractor wheels for the same reasons.

>Maybe they are thinking that the extra axle provides more support for a larger -- that is, heavier -- cabin?

By distributing the weight over 4 tires instead of 2 they can use smaller tires for the same weight load.

Imagine you're trying to load the largest object possible into a room with immovable boxes in the corners, it would probably be easier if [the boxes were smaller](https://i.imgur.com/38tk870.png) and [lower like this](https://i.imgur.com/iVweswB.png).",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o5ry4d/lexus_seriously_wants_to_replace_ls_with_this_bev/njbxw78/,2,positive,0.8552,Service,After-sales,Service experience

The phone app is slow and unresponsive and constantly signs me out even though I have “Keep me signed in “ checked. The ‘digital key’ feature has never worked.

In the Crown it’s my wife’s phone that the main profile and I’m driving and she’s scrolling and the radio is going off and switching to her phone audio back and forth it’s aggravating.

2.	Software architecture: Pleos is built on a completely different foundation than the Gen5W (2022-2024) and ccNC (2025) platforms.

The 2026 model year will likely still be on ccNC, but the 2027 lineup will definitely launch with Pleos Connect natively.

Think of how a car 'nosedives' slightly when you slow down. That's a huge amount of weight shifting off the rear wheels and onto the front ones. Even on a heavy car, the rear gets significantly lighter. Because the rear wheels now have less weight pressing them down, their traction limit is lower.

Here's a few things to consider though, as cold weather definitely needs to be factored in.  Typically you will only charge to 80%, and you should never go below 10% if possible. So you Typically get 70% of the theoretical max range, so if the max range of your vehicle is 250, you really only get 175 under normal conditions. In cold weather, between reduced battery efficiency, snow tires increased rolling resistance, using the heater,  and denser cold air, I see a 30% hit on range (I'm commuting from northeast pa to the NY southern tier, morning temps will often be 0-20f in January and February. If you plan to see colder than that you will have a little bigger hit to range). So that would bring that theoretical range down to 122.5 miles. If that exceeds your round trip, and you plan to install a L2 charger at home so you can fully charge back to 80% overnight, you're fine. For those longer trips you might need to make sure there's an L3 charger on your route. That hit to range is affected by using the heat, so using heated seats, heated steering, driver only environment, and a vehicle equipped with a heat pump, preheating while plugged in will all help mitigate the efficiency hit.

reddit,2025-10-13T16:26:45,Alexthelightnerd,"Minnesotan here: I've had ICE vehicles fail on me in bitter cold far more often than EVs. I had the wonderful experience years ago with my old Audi A3 in a parking lot at -30F where I needed to jump start a frozen battery, then the car wouldn't drive more than 10 miles per hour because the throttle controller was frozen. So I had to sit and wait idling for half an hour to warm up the engine, then take the risk of turning the car off and starting it again to clear the error. It started, but then I had a long cold drive home as the cabin heater couldn't keep up with the -30F wind at highway speed. Thankfully I had an emergency sleeping bag in the back I wrapped myself in to stay warm.

My EV just works in the winter. So many fewer parts to freeze or fluids to warm up, and it's a lot harder to freeze an EV battery. Plus the cabin heats much faster. Long trips are actually better than short trips in cold weather with an EV, as constant discharge warms the battery pack. You need to fast charge more often, but heat buildup from fast charging is also less of a problem because cooling the battery is easier. I would much rather drive an EV in bitter cold than an ICE.

I think you're misunderstanding that rating because there are absolutely no heat pumps on the market that will output 100% of their rated heating BTUs at -5f. That 100% at -5f is most certainly it's overall efficiency, or the temperature where the Coefficient of Performance (COP) = 1.

PTC heaters are basically hair dryers. They use alot of power to heat up and then once they reach operating temps, their energy consumption drops down. As they get hotter, their resistance goes up and thus their heating slows down. Self-regulating like that. The HVAC system blows air across a grid heating the air and thus the cabin and its occupants. 

I agree with what you said about heat pumps. More efficient that PTCs in cold weather though the PTC in our car is fine at 25F+ temps which is about all we get here.

reddit,2025-10-13T17:50:17,VTbuckeye,"It is likely just for the cabin. Depending on the car it may also heat the battery. However, many  people talk about remote starting and battery preconditioning and say how it improves efficiency. This is true with regards to efficiency while driving, but overall the car will consume more energy in total if remote starting/preconditioning (for many people this is not a concern). For example f150 lightning with 10 mile drive may get 2.5 miles per kWh if preconditioned and everything is warm, but 1.8 if everything is cold. Warm =4kWh for the trip, cold =5.6kWh. However 30 minutes of preconditioning may have used 3+kWh if power, so cold =5.6 total and warm =7kWh total consumed. If charging at home this may or may not be a big deal but if not plugged in preconditioning takes away range but the car will likely be much more comfortable for you. 

The longer the drive the more preconditioning helps (ever gets closer to operating temperature and the zero miles per kWh gets spread over more miles and may allow for greater overall efficiency). If you are going to dcfc then battery preconditioning (manual or automatic depending on the car) is very important because a warm battery can accept a faster charge than a cold battery. 

Sometimes I will adjust my charging schedule so that the battery finishes charging just before I leave. The battery will be warmer from charging and therefore more efficient while driving initially, but i didn't use any extra energy for heating that wasn't already required for charging. 

Tldr: If preconditioning for a short drive do it for your comfort, not because you will consume less energy while driving.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o5l0pq/question_about_evs_in_cold_winters/njb5rwn/,2,positive,0.9943,Product,Battery & Charging,Fast charging praised

My EV has a heat pump plus a resistive heating element (plus a steering wheel heater, which I never had in any of my ICE cars, that's nice). In short trips it is no contest at all, the EV produces almost instant heat (the heat pump takes a minute or two to generate full heat). I've done 15 minute trips in an ICE where the car just started producing moderately warm air by the time I arrived at the destination. Over longer trips performance is closer, but I find my EV to still be more comfortable. Maybe it's the heated steering wheel.

>Range cut by 2/3?

*By 2/3* - meaning only getting 1/3 the normal range? Absolutely not. A range cut by about 1/3, getting about 2/3 the normal range is more realistic. A 50% range reduction is about the absolute worst case scenario in most EVs, and that's only for short trips, as battery warming will normalize the range numbers over longer trips. On the coldest days of the year I need to plug in my car every night instead of every few days, that's the only practical consequence of the range reduction for me.

>And many ev have trouble fast charging a really cold battery.

Not in most scenarios. To have trouble with cold battery charging you usually need to take a cold car and go fast charge it right away. How often does that happen? Most of the time I fast charge I've been driving for at least an hour already, and in that case the battery will be warm enough to be able to fast charge without issue.

Take power the vehicle’s heat pump requires in -40F and what do you have left to charge with on L1 at 12a?

The answer is… Not much charge for the vehicle because no heat pump is rated for -40. The new cold climates are rated for -22ish. The vehicle needlessly wastes energy trying to warm up, negating any tangible charge.

Polestars are seen in most of Europe as electric Volvos and people really like Volvos.  

Also, the American model of selling cars through dealers is pretty local. In many places dealers don’t operate anything like they do in the US if only because there’s a far tighter space constraint and you can’t have hundreds of cars parked somewhere outside all the time it’s just not practical.

reddit,2025-10-14T13:26:20,Fatoy,"I drove a Polestar 2 for a couple of years. Outside of the infotainment (which was awful) and some vetigial holdovers from the ICE platform (the transmission tunnel in the rear) it was an excellent car to drive and own, and I was excited for what they were going to do next.

As you rightly pointed out, the 3 was just way too expensive. It's also not big enough to appeal to the people who buy massive luxury SUVs, so with one model they lost the volume market that the 2 served, and shut themselves out of the top end market they could have effectively pursued. Anecdotally, I think I've seen 5 Polestar 3s, tops, on UK roads since they released. I see more Lotus Eletres!

The 4 is a weird car. I don't mind the lack of a rear window, since rear visibility is crap on most modern cars. But what segment is this car actually in? It's not markedly longer (4cm apparently) than a BYD Seal or an Ioniq 6, so I guess it's a saloon / sedan? But then it's only a bit higher than the Polestar 2 (4cm ish) but seems to be positioned as a mid-sized SUV equivalent in terms of practicality?

There are quite a few 4s on the roads and in the school car park at the moment, so I think the end-of-model-year lease deals must be kicking in. But every time I see someone loading the boot of one I'm surprised at how little cargo space they have compared to ""proper"" family cars.

There's no question that Polestar have an incredible design team. The upcoming 5 in particular is a work of art. But I don't understand what they're doing with the positioning of their current line-up at all. Aside from the 2, I just don't get who these cars are supposed to be for. They're not sedans; they're not SUVs; they're not full-on luxury cars but they're not mass market. They don't stand out at the capability or feature level compared to other, cheaper cars from the same Chinese stables.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o5mziy/polestar_closes_last_direct_store_in_china_amid/njg0l2v/,2,positive,0.6821,Product,Software & Display,App/OTA mention

Granted, we got subsidies, but they just about offset the cost of the extra hoops and technical complexity we had to jump through as compared to a lot of more pedestrian solar setups coming out of China, where you could have an equivalent system whose install cost is about 1/3rd of what we'd have paid.

There are tons of how-to guides on installing these system, and their usage is a somewhat grey area (not made easier by the capricious and arbitrary legalization on what counts as legal here, as well as the excessive meddling by the power company). 

I hope that unlike us, American homeowners have enough of a backbone to enforce that the jurisdiction of power companies ends at the power meter.

With that said, I'm not a fan of subsidies, and I'm firmly of the opinion that with ever falling hardware prices, a simplified install process (it shouldn't be more involved than running a couple wires from the panels to a 'box' that contains the inverter and battery, then splicing it into the junction box), solar will become a cost-competitive measure by itself in the near future.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o5ukji/electric_vehicles_and_fixing_home_solar_in_the_us/njc570c/,5,positive,0.7856,Product,Battery & Charging,Battery mention

We did it because (1) our area is prone to power outages from hurricanes  and (2) we believe it’s better for the environment than other means of electricity generation. 

No, we didn’t do it for financial reasons as the numbers wouldn’t work for us.  The numbers work if you can finance the system with purchase of your home over 20-30 years. Having no electric bill and not having to buy gas will generally offset the difference in the mortgage payment if you live in an area with high electric bills, as in the southern US. 

Our biggest obstacle was that the companies we talked to had no idea how to determine how many panels or batteries we needed. Their reps are not well trained. The first proposal came in at 30 panels and one battery for a 4500 sqft home with three air conditioners and a swimming pool. I am not an engineer but just from reading their websites, we knew that was not enough.  Each battery only allows 5kwh to the home at any one time. 

So, training would be helpful. Perhaps lenders could offer a solar option when financing a house? 

Also, the electric companies could do a better job at explaining the programs. Our plan will buy back our excess power until our bill hits a zero balance each month and that’s all. I can’t tell you how many people have told us that other companies will allow us to rollover the amount not credited against our future bills. When we looked into them we found that they charge retail rates(around 16 cents) but credit you at wholesale rates (around 5 cents). On those plans, there’s not much left to rollover. Our plan credits us at the same rate we are charged.

I basically don't trust any power provider (except maybe a co-op, but I don't live in one of the places covered by one of those) to not raise rates as high as they're allowed.

My wife and I have talked about buying a farm and turning it into the kind of subdivision we'd like to live in, with houses like what I've described (what I think of as the middle class house of the future), no bogus HOA rules etc. but it would take winning the lottery.

That's just a dream though.  Before I know it I'll be moving to a retirement apartment of some sort, hopefully the kind of place that has nurses on call to change my diapers when needed, and I don't know how to make a facility like that be as self-sufficient.

Maybe that makes it an interesting design challenge.  Maybe you give each apartment their own battery, charge it with cheap local solar each day, and if they use more than that, they pay the regular utility bend-over-and-think-of-england rate.  You could probably put solar panels on or near balconies for ease of maintenance (and of course on the roof).

I've thought a little bit about a non air based heat pump system for apartment buildings.  Have the temperature exchange be piped around the building and connected to a geothermal heat exchange, something like that, and each apartment's heating and cooling is still performed by the individual unit.  I wonder if you could work that into heated flooring without making a maintenance nightmare.

Water gets trickier.  Solar heated water is good.  Maybe each apartment has a local unit to turn warm water into hot water.  Does the heat come from the building temperature exchange system? Maybe...

reddit,2025-10-14T01:04:27,ByeStandards8,"Going to offer up a few thoughts on all this - for context, my family leased two new EVs (F150 Lightning and Mach E) before the tax credit expired and we have put a down payment on solar with whole home battery back up + Span panel, with the goal of installing before Jan 1.

1.) While my aim isn't to make this post political, one major party in America is hellbent on eliminating green energy solutions.  I don't know if they're so deeply embedded to fossil fuel companies, or if they just hate green energy for the sake of hating it, but their actions (canceling tax incentives, canceling larger municipal projects) create real headwinds for the industry and consumers alike.  In an environment where the government does not want to see these portion of the energy sector succeed, it will be hard to see the exponential growth here in the U.S. that we see across the rest of the developed world.

2.) Education - whether its about EVs or home solar - is severely lacking.  Unfortunately, I think that some of this is by design.  People don't seem to understand that today's EV's are incredible cars that not only reduce carbon footprint, but also personal expenses.  No more gas, regular maintenance, etc, is really freeing.  Additionally, (some of) these vehicles can be used as back up generators, which is an incredible advantage.  But dealerships aren't very educated on these products - in most cases, I knew more about the cars I was buying that anyone at any of the Ford dealerships I visited.  Dealers may also be hesitant to commit to EV sales because there is less long term money (in maintenance specifically) to be made vs ICE vehicles.

When it comes to residential solar, and how to optimize solar for our home - I am again finding that I know more than most retailers.  Most sales people I encountered seemed to be checking boxes, when there are a variety of fantastic, (relatively) cost effective solutions in the marketplace that create opportunities for energy independence, and resilience.  But getting into it can be daunting.  People talk in acronyms, equipment information isn't always easy to decipher, equipment compatibility is also challenging to decode.  There are so many options, and so many brands trying to convince you one social media video at a time that they have the right thing for you.  Some (Tesla/Enphase) are exorbitantly priced, others are priced more fairly but there are risks with the warranties, or viability of the company.

Even major vendors are figuring things out on the fly - Franklinwh (who we are going to use for our home back up system) claims to have a Vehicle-to-Load capability.  But to achieve that, they instruct consumers to clip the neutral from a 240v cord connecting your vehicle to the generator inlet - which is not code compliant and  in some instances can be incredibly dangerous.  It took hours of research and conversations with electricians to determine that we can plug the car into a small transformer, which then plugs into the Franklin system.  

3.) Other advancements need to be made for this snowball to really get moving down the hill.  High volume energy storage solutions, affordability programs, and industry standardization need to be devised and implemented.  

4.) Not every state and every energy company is working in synch to deliver the same benefits of solar.  We know this first hand being in Ohio, where general solar installations are tied to the grid, giving consumers a credit that is equivalent to 65 cents vs every dollar they spend on energy.  Without a whole home system, we'd spend all this money, just to sell it to the utility at a 35% discount.  We have instead opted for a solution that gives us battery back up, allowing us to island our home, because the energy we produce is more valuable if we use it, than if we ship it to the utility.   But I had to DIG to find this out.  Multiple calls to my utility to learn about the rates, the credits, and how it was all calculated.  The people selling these products simply aren't educated enough to properly inform consumers about how it all works, and what they're really investing in.   
  
In the mean time, my family and I are all in, tax credit or not, lucrative state/federal incentive or not.    
  
I never want to stop at a gas station again.  I never want to worry about the food in my fridge and freezer when a storm knocks out the power for a few days.  I don't want grid failures to affect my family's day-to-day life. 

And I consider our effort to be patriotic.  We have purchased American made (or in the case of the Mach E, American engineered) vehicles, American made solar panels and micro inverters, and an American made home back up system.  We're putting our money where our mouths are, and betting that this is the future - whether or not certain members of government believe it.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o5ukji/electric_vehicles_and_fixing_home_solar_in_the_us/njdf34f/,2,positive,0.9971,Product,Battery & Charging,Range mention

1) Political problems require political solutions; maybe we’ll get the chance, maybe we won’t.

2) Education is a massive issue in this space. Most homeowners have no idea what’s going on. And even worse, most of them think they do! I really think small, plug in systems, priced at a few hundred dollars or less, could be a game changer here. No learning like hands-on learning. 

I think you’re right about the dealerships though, I’ve never been to one that was enthusiastic about EVs. I was looking at a Sierra EV a few months ago, and the salesman told me, “no one buys those, they suck.” I asked him why, and got crickets. 🤷

I think it’s important for the brands themselves to lead the way, but in this climate…

3) Technology, yes. The cost curves for battery tech are still a long ways off from maturing. Simplicity too; plug-and-play to minimize the need for electricians and to make systems expandable or updatable in the future. 

4) The utilities need massive political reform. They should be considered critical infrastructure, publicly owned, and run at cost.

reddit,2025-10-13T22:09:51,AreMarNar,"Don't know where you live, but the math is that solar replaces an existing cost. And with zero-down financing, the opportunity cost is vs. the utility, not the hypothetical better investment - you can do both. Put $20k into your HYSA, and you'll still be sending $100, $200, whatever amount/month to the utility. Solar is a better way to spend *that* money. To say nothing of power purchase agreements, which are even easier. 

But I do think the complexity inherent in financial thinking like this, whichever way you land, is a barrier for a lot of Americans.

My son used to work for Tzubaki (chain manufacturers for many big car brands) as a production engineer. He used to tell me how certain manufacturers were forever demanding cheaper timing chains from them. A couple of pence saved on every chain meant many thousands of pounds more profit for them. We own a Renault Trafic with a 2.0 diesel engine, which had been owned from new as a “Motabiluty” vehicle, and it had a full main dealer service history. At 95,000 miles it suddenly refused to start. The timing chain was so badly worn that thankfully the ECU software shut it down because the valve timing was outside safe limits. Two garages said they weren’t interested in doing the job. I did it myself and soon realised why. There is an instructional video showing a Renault mechanic changing the chain. The engine is out of the vehicle….. Apparently they quote twelve hours labour for the job. When I finally got to the chain, after a very long dismantling process, I was horrified how cheap and flimsy it was.

reddit,2025-10-13T03:24:57,rtb001,"EREVs are a subset of PHEVs and strictly speaking a car can only be an EREV if there is zero connection between the engine and the drivetrain.

Even the BYD Shark, which is almost 100% operating in EREV type mode, still is a PHEV because it still maintains that connection between the engine and the drivetrain.

Hell even Honda hybrids, which aren't even PHEV, just a ""mild hybrid"" spend a lot of time with the engine charging the battery and the motors driving the car, but you certainly won't call them EREVs.

So why would BYD or Geely put these extra drivetrain parts into their hybrid system even though it operates like an EREV most of the time? Because 1) they are going for max efficiency and 2) they know these cars, which are fitted with smaller batteries, will have to operate more often using engine power, which is why they put up with adding complexity by adding direct connections between engine and wheels, because they know the car will need to use that connection often.

If you look at true EREVs on the market, the one thing they share is that they will almost always have larger batteries than non-EREV PHEVs. Because they have that larger battery, the expectation is that the car will operate in pure electric mode most of the time, so you can skip the complexity of the engine to wheel components and just make the ICE motor a generator. Since the expectation is that you will charge the car often and use the ICE much less frequently, they don't care that when you are using the ICE, the EREV is significantly less efficient than a PHEV using its ICE.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o4zeo1/a_chinese_erev_tried_to_drive_1_million/nj7rdbb/,8,positive,0.9204,Product,Battery & Charging,Battery mention

> a dual clutch to control the working mode rather than using a single-speed gear as in the older generations

Furthermore, they claim that unlike older gen BYD DM systems, where ""the engine largely acted as a generator with the motor driving the car"", DM 5.0 adds on top of that a ""double planetary gear system"" that can more efficiently divert engine power towards power generation, direct driving of the wheels, or some combination of both.

I'm not sure I understand it all, or that they claim this to be the definitive way the system works, but overall it seems to be a more complex system compared to previous DM 4.0, and not a EREV setup with a simple added ""clutch and chain"" to do some limited direct driving of the wheels at certain speeds.

People now credit Wan with making the national decision to go all-in on electric vehicles.

Why China Built 162 Square Miles of Solar Panels on the World’s Highest Plateau

>China’s clean energy efforts contrast with the ambitions of the United States under the Trump administration, which is using its diplomatic and economic muscle to pressure other countries to buy more American gas, oil and coal. China is investing in cheaper solar and wind technology, along with batteries and electric vehicles, with the aim of becoming the world’s supplier of renewable energy and the products that rely on it.

Tesla emerged DESPITE these obstacles and it is a tribute they were able to do it in California where at least a genuine entrepeneurial spirit exists to an extent it does not in other parts of the country. Tesla has shifted away from California and I sense they are struggling a bit more in both Austin & Berlin. The supply chain China has built for electronic assembly (thanks to the early involvement with Apple), batteries (largely homegrown innovation) and complex manufacturing  is stellar. It is why it seems to me that despite lots of unbridled claims, the supply chain necessary for autonomous robots will be there and those that wish to make them will need their involvement. 

BYD gets a lot of attention and they are indeed formidable. Companies graduating from consumer and business electronics (Huawei & Xiaomi) are unlike any car companies before them. BYD likewise operates their own chip fabs and still does a remarkable amount of handset and tablet assembly. These companies making the jump to automobiles is possible with a SDC and the lower dependence on the Rube Goldberg support equipment needed for an ICE vehicle. So many components have been replaced by focusing on exceptional batteries, electric motors and high-speed switching equipment.

The US lacks a stable and consistent support system for the EV transition. Tesla did it DESPITE the US government. It was probably only possible with their California roots and support for the green future.  Now, Tesla and Musk are allied with the party most likely to undermine and destroy an emerging EV landscape. For Tesla this is fine as they prevent competition at home and have strayed quite far from their climate and tranformation goals. This is the centerpiece of Chinese moves to eliminate the demand for the four primary refined products of crude oil (gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and kerosene). They are well on their way. We are stuck with a political party which actively undermines any competition to fossil fuels. The future belongs to the Xiaomi's. Tesla, as long as they toe the line in Beijing can at least coexist with that superior supply chain.

ICE have a relatively narrow torque/power/efficiency bands. Therefore many gear are needed to cover common driving scenarios. Look at trucks, Those have relatively weak engines compared to their weight, therefore even more gears are needed to make good use of whatever power they have available (and their fuiel economy is generaly seen as more important than on a privately owned car). Manuals have generally topped up at 6 gears, but automatics often have 8 or more.

  
electric motors have a MUCH wider torque/power/efficiency band. therefore less gears are needed to achieve the target specificatoins for output power and efficienct across common driving scenarios.  And it turns out, that even a single gear is often enough. Some cars have 2, some trucks have 3. EV conversions sometimes keep the original transmission in place, but not always.

in the end you are making a comprimise. a single gear transmission is simpler, lighter, and likely has less transmission losses than a more complex, multi gear one. You definetly are gaining efficiency by adding more gears (hence a CVT can be really efficiecnt). But the question is, am i gaining more efficiency on the motor side this way than i am losing on the gearing and weight  side? if yes . add more gears, it will improve efficiency.

reddit,2025-10-14T09:26:49,sprezzaturans,"It’s great that you’re thinking about this, but your problem statement has some flaws.

It’s true that EVs aren’t as efficient at highway speeds, but it doesn’t have as much to do with the transmission as it does with drag and regenerative braking.

Drag goes up exponentially as speed increases because of the forces at play, we don’t drive in a vacuum so the car has to push against the air to get anywhere and that gets harder and harder the faster you go because the car has to push through more air molecules in a given time period as speed increases.

At the same time, there are fewer opportunities for energy regeneration at highway speed because you’re not slowing down or stopping very much on the highway. Regenerative braking is a huge reason why EVs are so efficient in city driving, every stop light, stop sign, and slowdown is an opportunity to turn inertia back into electricity, and that just shouldn’t happen as much on the highway.

Transmissions help a gas engine be more efficient at highway speeds because of a flaw inherent to the four-stroke gas engine; each cylinder goes through intake, compression, power, and exhaust, but is only generating energy during the last two phases. This means the engine only has a very narrow torque band where it’s operating at its maximum efficiency and generating as much energy from the fuel as it possibly can, usually between 2,000-5,000 RPM.

The transmission in a gas car exists to translate that narrow torque band into useable forward momentum by converting the high revolution, low torque output of the engine into low revolution, high torque rotation of the wheels using gears at different ratios. This allows the engine to run at its ideal RPM range to get the most bang out of the fuel, while converting that energy to the right wheel rotation to move the car at all the speeds between 0 and 100+ mph.

None of that is really necessary for an electric motor.

The speed at which an EV motor rotates can be adjusted simply by modulating the current input, and there are no “strokes” like the gas engine, the motor outputs constant power-generating rotation. This makes for a motor that is efficient across a very wide torque band, about 5,000 to 10,000 RPM, so going faster or slower can be dictated by simply putting more or less current in the motor.

The transmission in an EV is still necessary, but it only takes a single reduction gear because the speed of the motor itself is almost infinitely adjustable where a gas engine has a very narrow “sweet spot” and relies on the gearing to adjust speed.

The EVs that have multiple gears, like the Porsche Taycan, actually use their extra gear to improve low RPM off-the-line performance, improving the efficiency of launch acceleration, not highway cruising.

A gearbox would certainly make the driving experience more engaging, but the challenge there would be that an EV motor’s RPM start where a typical gas engine ends. A gearbox that would be effective in the RPM range EV motors are most efficient at would require some very complex engineering and exotic materials to withstand the forces involved, adding more weight and cost without adding much in the way of efficiency.

This is why performance EVs like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 N use a simulated gearbox instead of trying for real gears, I encourage you to check it out:

reddit,2025-10-14T08:55:06,Powerful-Test-8309,"The main reason we don't need complex gearboxes in EVs boils down to the fundamental difference in their power curves:

* **Gas Engines:** Have a very narrow ""power band"" (usually between 2,000 - 6,000 RPM). They produce very little torque at low RPMs, can't exceed a ""redline,"" and become inefficient at high RPMs. **Gears are essential** to keep the engine spinning in its happy, powerful range regardless of vehicle speed.
* **Electric Motors:** Have an incredibly wide power band. They produce **maximum torque instantly from 0 RPM**. They can also spin to extremely high RPMs (often 20,000 RPM) without exploding. This means a single gear can efficiently cover a huge speed range, from crawling in traffic to cruising on the highway.

# Why Your Idea of a 7-Speed Gearbox Isn't Used

1. **Efficiency Loss:** Every gear mesh, every bearing, and every rotating part in a complex gearbox creates friction and saps power. A single-speed reduction gear in most EVs is already over 95% efficient. Adding 6 more gears would introduce more points of energy loss, **reducing the car's overall efficiency and range**.
2. **Complexity, Cost, and Weight:** A conventional 7-speed transmission is heavy, expensive, and takes up a lot of space. One of the biggest advantages of EVs is their simplicity and reduced number of moving parts. Adding a complex gearbox would negate this benefit, increasing manufacturing costs, maintenance potential, and weight (which further hurts range).
3. **It's Unnecessary:** An electric motor can efficiently propel a car from 0 to over 100 mph with a single gear. The motor simply spins faster as the car goes faster. There's no ""lugging"" at low speed or ""hitting the redline"" at high speed like in a gas car.

# Where Your Idea is Actually RIGHT (And Being Used!)

You are correct that a single gear is a compromise. While it's great for 99% of driving, there are two specific scenarios where adding a gearbox makes sense:

* **High Performance (The Porsche Taycan / Audi e-tron GT):** These cars use a **2-speed gearbox** on the rear axle. The first gear is for mind-bending acceleration from a standstill. At higher speeds, it shifts into a taller second gear for more efficient high-speed cruising and top speed. This is the closest implementation to your idea.
* **Extreme Top Speed / Hypercars (Rimac Nevera):** Some ultra-high-performance EVs use 2-speed gearboxes to achieve their insane top speeds (over 250 mph) without the motor having to spin at astronomically high RPMs.

# What About the Sound for Racing?

This is a really interesting point! The distinctive ""whir"" of an electric motor doesn't have the same visceral drama as gear changes in a sequential racing gearbox. However, some electric racing series are experimenting with **artificial sounds** that mimic gearshifts to make it more engaging for spectators. But from an engineering perspective, adding a physical gearbox just for sound would be a step backwards in performance and efficiency.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o69u0o/i_have_an_idea_during_school_and_is_this/njf1yae/,-2,positive,0.9671,Product,Battery & Charging,Fast charging praised

As far as I'm aware, the pressure of ever-skinnier wheels are largely driven by automotive media & magazines, as well as influencers/KOLs.

When you look at the long range SE there’s still a huge feature gap to the M3 or MY Standard. The SEL RWD closes this and is the same price as the Model Y Standard. The Teslas are faster than the RWD Hyundais by a fair amount.

If not, until you get to the SEL the ioniq5 lacks power fold mirrors, phone as key, rear hvac vents, power liftgate, wireless phone charging, and more. None of these are deal breakers and kudos to Hyundai for offering lower trims at lower price. The equipment isn’t that different than a Toyota rav4 hybrid at the same price which is well done by Hyundai and all EVs. The SEL has some features the MY doesn’t but is slower 0-60. The $36.5k (for 26) equinox is missing a lot relative to the equivalent price ioniq5 or MY, like power front seats, heated seats, or even vanity mirrors, and the fast charging is bad. 

The fast charging difference is a bit overblown imo. In 15 mins, assuming the Ioniq5 gets access to a 800V charger you’ll recover 175 to the teslas 160.

I don’t mind them because they’re among the safest vehicles on the road: they obey all of the laws, they come to full stops, they use their turn indicators, etc., unlike too many (most ?) L.A. drivers. Sure, they don’t look cool with all the external sensors, but they’re working today, not some bullshit Hollywood studio production like last year where the Tesla Robotaxis were driving pre-programmed routes.
Are Waymos perfect? No. Funny anecdote: traffic lights were out on a major boulevard at night earlier this year, and I was in the right lane anticipating getting on the freeway in less than a mile. I was behind easily 15 cars; none moving. Got out of the right lane and into the center, drove up to the intersection. You guessed it: a Waymo was stopped at the intersection, at the front of the line of cars: its brain farted at the lights being out at the intersection, and it couldn’t figure out what to do, so it froze. About a week later, my spouse pulled up next to a Waymo with an employee sitting in the passenger seat. She got his attention, and told him this story. He thanked her and said, “This is the real-world stuff we need to know.” The Waymos are continually getting better, and their futuristic-looking larger capacity blue cars are being seen now. Point is, re Robotaxis, Google/Waymo is leaving Tesla in their dust, so to speak. Tesla is so far behind, and getting further behind every day. My Millennial daughter takes Waymos because there’s no male driver bs to put up with, just a safe, quiet ride to get her where she’s going.

reddit,2025-10-12T13:51:38,timnuoa,"At this point Tesla exists for the primary purpose of keeping the Tesla stock price at its insanely inflated levels, which it can only do by selling grandiose visions of the future. It’s not enough to be a good (or even the best) EV company, they have to promise that Tesla robo-taxis will render all other forms of transportation obsolete. See also the goofy humanoid robots.

Edit2: the text below incorrectly conflates earnings with revenue. The numbers work out about the same if you use price/sales ratios (which are actually revenues). No time to type it all out right now but I will later.

Edit: Since I did all this math, I may as well post it (this is all pretty back-of-the-envelope, but gets at the orders of magnitude involved).

Mature car companies (Toyota, GM, etc) trade at a multiple of about 8 times earnings, meaning that the company’s total stock market value is about 8 years of revenues. Tesla is currently trading at about 250 times earnings.

So if Tesla is going to be a mature company in 10 years, trading at a mature company valuation, it’ll need to multiply revenues by about 31 times to justify the current stock price. But of course nobody is buying Tesla stock expecting it to be stagnant for 10 years. Assuming a healthy 6% annual growth, Tesla stock would be up 80% over 10 years, meaning we need to multiply that 31 by 1.8, which is 56. Tesla needs to 56x their revenues to justify the stock price over the next 10 years.

They have about a 3% global market share, so that means that in 10 years they would need to be selling 1.5 times as many cars as total global car sales today.

Tesla is not going to justify their stock price as a regular car company, even the greatest one in the world, which is why they keep promising to be more.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o4lch0/the_worst_thing_that_ever_happened_to_tesla/nj3p28h/,78,positive,0.9918,Product,Software & Display,App/OTA mention

He announced no upgrade from HW3 until the rumblings of a class action lawsuit started up, and then he announced that there would be a processor upgrade at a later time. (Yeah, right). In the meantime, my car would not hold the set speed in Chill mode, refused to drive in the right lane in Standard mode even when there was traffic approaching rapidly behind me and the right lane was clear for a mile or so ahead of me, waited too long to switch lanes when approaching a slower car and would lose speed and often then get trapped in the lane as other cars started to pass me, etc. On secondary roads, it was too hesitant, and then would floor it. It was sometimes too aggressive, trying to turn left across rapidly approaching traffic. FSD worked well for me on the highway a couple of years ago, but they ruined it for me when they decided that the car had the ultimate decisions over speed and lane choice.

Owning one means that I can customize it exactly how I want. Owning one means that I know it is only as dirty as my family has made it. And we're coming from a place where we're accustomed to paying tens of thousands for vehicles so, while it might cost less to do a rideshare, I could see people still springing for one for the convenience. 

Look at my boardgame example. There are some people that would want two benches and a table as their interior. But others might hate that and might just want a mattress to sleep or just relax on. You get to customize your own vehicle to be exactly what you want, and that matters for daily use and long trips.

But yes, rideshares would definitely become a viable alternative and likely a more affordable one. But there would be a lot of details to be worked out. Customers would want the rideshare to be cheap but also to be perfectly prompt - you can only arrive late to work so many times before concluding that the rideshare isn't working for you. And the way to achieve near-perfect promptness is by leaving windows between scheduled rides and having more vehicles on the road, which in turn raises costs. And how often are they goinjg home to be cleaned, which also raises costs? 

It feels like the lesson of the last 20 or so years in tech is that any corporation will not simply be happy to make a profit but will want to squeeze squeeze every lost dollar out of us by making the experience as bad (inexpensive for them) as possible, but where we still pay them for it. And rather than make their product/service better, they'll simply buy any competition. I suspect that any rideshare company like this would be great for 5-10 years and would quickly be enshittified.

reddit,2025-10-12T14:16:00,Zarndell,"> I’ve read direct quotes stating that vision only FSD is the way he’s wanted to go from the beginning human beings. Don’t have laser shooting out of their eyes and they drive just fine.

Humans have a lot of processing done + depth perception. But yeah, camera only FSD was Elon's idea of the system.

>Not only that extra sensors put extra work on the main processing computer

They don't actually. A lot more processing happens because of vision-only. A LIDAR sensor telling you exactly where that big object is takes almost no processing power. It's a fairly simple idea, yet yeah, still somewhat expensive because of the resolution. This is why Elon didn't start with a vision only FSD: because there was no way to process images in a way to allow it.

>and if you have a discrepancy between one censor and another, it can confuse the system

Yeah, but not really. This is why you have separate systems doing what they are best at. Radar/LIDAR does the best recognition of big objects. They can even recognize humans if you need it, based on shape. Cameras are necessary to detect road markings, road signs and traffic lights. You can have other sensors for temperature, humidity to know the driving conditions.

And I'm not even going into details like heavy rain (where rain actually creates vapour when they hit the ground and vision gets misty), and fog, where the cameras are night useless even with IR.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o4lch0/the_worst_thing_that_ever_happened_to_tesla/nj3t7bf/,9,positive,0.9656,Product,Software & Display,App/OTA mention

About $1.27 billion dollar net loss in 1H 2025 to deliver 6,418 vehicles, for a net loss per vehicle of $198,000.

On the other end of the spectrum, looking at strictly variable cost of production (removing R&D, SG&A, and capex depreciation, basically just revenue - COGS - estimated capex depreciation), they lost about $25,000 per vehicle, on an average selling price of $78,000.

The more they make, the more they lose. They have been burning $2-3 billion a year. Cumulative free cash flow since public operations commenced in 2021 has been $10 billion to deliver 16,659 vehicles, or a cash flow burn of $613,000 per vehicle. Of course, that looks worse with Gravity barely at any sales volume, but it’s been 4 years and Rawlinson’s projections when the SPAC was being shopped were laughably wrong.

reddit,2025-10-13T16:37:35,FruitOrchards,">Mercedes has received permission from the state of California to sell cars which feature Level 3 Drive Pilot technology to the public. But the permission comes with some restrictions: “This permit excludes operation on city or county streets, in construction zones, during heavy rain or heavy fog, on flooded roads and during weather conditions that are determined to impact performance of DRIVE PILOT. Vehicle owners must watch a mandatory video explaining the capabilities of the system and how to engage and disengage the technology before Mercedes-Benz will activate DRIVE PILOT in the vehicle.”

https://cleantechnica.com/2023/06/09/california-approves-mercedes-level-3-drive-pilot-technology-with-limitations

The article is from 2023* however many of the restrictions are still in place due to the permit, not actually lack of ability. Also those limitations are also in other countries too.

Stage one reuse will likely be doable, at least to an acceptable level. But will they be able to consistently launch, orbit, reenter and a land without damaging the tiles, structure, engines, electronics etc? I have my doubts, mainly in the very high mass ratio demands. The dry weight of the orbital stage has to be tiny to accomplish their chosen architecture.

This is why I believe that an architecture, where the first stage does a larger portion of the work, is going to be more economical in the long run.

Edit: Also, the whole Mars thing is somewhat a separate issue from Starship. Even if a reusable rocket can only get to low earth orbit it would still be useful for a Mars mission, mainly as a space truck carrying components to an interplanetary ship. If you look at the 1960s shuttle concepts you will see that this is what they were planning to do with those designs. The shuttle would never leave earth orbit, but it would deliver fuel, food, structures etc. for crafts going to the moon and Mars.

reddit,2025-10-13T14:54:39,Vulnox,"It’s not to make a quick buck. Ford wouldn’t have been seeing losses from their EV division if it were that easy. 

While manufacturers can have higher transaction prices, the purpose is to make it so the can do that but the final price to the consumer is still reasonable. 

The benefit to manufacturers and buyers is the cost to build all these new plants, hire and train all these new employees, and designed and build these often bottom up new vehicles, or at least have significant changes, is insanely expensive. 

Companies just wouldn’t bother if it was almost all loss and risk. The tax credit does allow them to price a bit higher to offset those costs to encourage companies to make EVs, or whatever else is being incentivized. But that price increase isn’t a cash grab, it’s a cost offset. 

People talk like it was some big corporate greed thing, but it was always meant to make the new manufacturing more cost appropriate. For the Lightning Ford had to build a new factory (REVC) from the ground up. They were able to use a lot of the ICE manufacturing process up to the chassis/final sections, but REVC itself is still an all new build. 

They had to completely retool the Cuautitlan plant for the Mach-e. 

They also have to get battery manufacturing and sign new deals for that supply chain. 

And that’s just Ford. Companies like Tesla, Rivian, or Lucid are typically starting with nothing. It’s why despite strong sales even Tesla took a decade to see profit. It’s not that the sales aren’t there, it’s just immensely expensive to build vehicles.

reddit,2025-10-13T04:22:08,curio_123,"Short answer: No (as of Oct 2025)

Longer answer: Expect one in 2026. Why?

AFAIK, only Quantumscape and Factorial’s Solstice cells are true SSBs.

Quantumscape just started up its Cobra production line for its ceramic separator with a capacity of 100k starts per week. Its QSE-5 cell (21.6Wh or 5Ah) needs 24 separators per cell.

Given that a high end EV battery (e.g. the one used in Model Y LR) needs 75-80 kWh of juice, this means a working prototype QS SSB pack based on QSE-5 will need at least 75,000/21.6*24 = 83,333 separators. If production yield is 83.3%, then the QS pilot production line will churn out enough separators to make one EV battery pack a week at full capacity. In short, they’re in pilot production and can support up to 52 test vehicles in 2026. This means there is a very high probability that we’ll see a true SSB (pre-production) in a test vehicle sometime in 2026. 

Factorial’s FEST cell (not a true SSB) has been tested in EVs for over a year now but no results or announcements were made. Mercedes announced that it will test the Solstice cell (true SSB) in prototype EVs sometime in 2026 but AFAIK, no B-sample has been announced yet and there is no publicly disclosed plans for a pilot production line to make the key components. So, it is unlikely that the Solstice cell will be in a test vehicle in 2026.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o4m72s/are_there_any_prototype_evs_with_actual_solid/nj7yrbp/,1,negative,-0.5346,Product,Battery & Charging,Range mention

Then again the solid state batteries we thought had fantastic properties in the 1980s had the energy density of NIMH cells, and maybe the cost of modern LIPOs or something.

You know cheap enough to make demand shifting of a home’s power demand feasible, and maybe make portable computers with 4 hour run times a possibility.

Existing batteries do everything we once thought solid state batteries would do, and it is entirely possible that year over year gradual advancement will put “traditional” batteries where we currently thing solid state will bring us…

…but it is fun to think about one Big Leap, and a lot easier to get funding behind it, and if you need to justify as a CEO why you don’t have a market leading EV “we will launch one as soon as solid state batteries are ready because they eliminate all consumer reluctance”

…if you are a reporter which story will sell better: “Solid State barrels are coming, and they will change EVERYTHING!”, or “CATL’s next generation LiIon batteries are 6% less expensive, 4% more energy dense and charge 9% faster!”

I mean if you keep saying “soon” and eventually they do come someone had to be right….

I kind of doubt they will solve *all* problems.

I’m not sure if any do both at the same time.

In shipbuilding, a ‘swept stern’ is a rear end that gradually leaves the water. This allows a ship to cut through the water more efficiently, a trick that the new Hyundai Ioniq 3 seems to be applying to the air with a similar rear end.

Highlights Hyundai Ioniq 3

EV3 size, but totally different

Eye-catching rear end

Fourth and (for now) smallest Ioniq model

Leave it to Hyundai and sister brand Kia to come up with striking designs. The two Korean brands belong to the same group, but given that fact, they are given a remarkable amount of freedom to chart their own course. The models are completely unique in terms of design and are often not entirely identical technically, with, for example, a slightly different wheelbase or battery capacity for EVs. Other large car companies generally consider such seemingly insignificant differences to be far too expensive, but in South Korea they apparently believe that this distinction is important to guarantee the raison d'être of both brands. There is also no shortage of variety within both brands. Although Kia and Hyundai each have a recognizable design language with recurring elements, this certainly does not mean that all models look alike, especially at Hyundai. It is clear that the Ioniq 6 is related to the Ioniq 5, but the two are also completely different.

Prius

All of the above will soon be underscored by yet another new electric model from the Korean stable, the Hyundai Ioniq 3. In short, this is Hyundai's counterpart to the wildly popular Kia EV3, but apart from the technical aspects, everything else will be different, including the visual appearance. Hyundai already showed what the brand has in mind with the Concept Three, while spy photos make it clear that this concept car gives a good idea of what is to come. The Ioniq 3 will have a shape reminiscent of certain generations of the Toyota Prius, but in a taller and, above all, hipper form.

The car will have a remarkably high rear end with a split rear window, a sloping roofline, and a sharply rising shoulder line. The striking basic shape is complemented by the “pixel lighting” that defines the family look, rear lights integrated high in the rear, and a layered front. The result is a shape that will be instantly recognizable, although there may be some similarities with Hyundai's luxury brand Genesis' GV60. However, the latter is considerably larger, as the Ioniq 3 is expected to have a length of around 4.30 meters. This places it squarely in the EV3 class, which makes it interesting for the Netherlands by definition, as this is where the numbers are currently being made.

Supreme

This could pose a problem for Hyundai, because the electric Kona is also available and is about the same size. However, Kia has shown that this does not necessarily have to be a disadvantage. After all, that brand faced the same ‘challenge’ with the Niro and the EV3, but the supreme EV3 cannot prevent the Niro from finishing in third place for the time being. According to Kia, the two cars simply appeal to different target groups, which is undoubtedly what Hyundai is also hoping to achieve. Based purely on electric performance, the front-wheel-drive Ioniq 3 will wipe the floor with the Kona, because unlike that car, the Ioniq is a purely electric model on the E-GMP platform. Expect battery packs of roughly 60 or about 80 kWh, 204 hp electric motors, and an electric range of between (approximately) 440 and over 500 kilometers. Indeed: completely comparable to what the Kia EV3 already has to offer. The fast-charging capacity will also be comparable at 100 to 130 kW, while the Ioniq 3 will also feature vehicle-to-load technology. The Hyundai Ioniq 3 will be the fourth model in the Ioniq series after the Ioniq 5, Ioniq 6, and Ioniq 9 and will be available next year. That's nice and quick, but not a moment too soon: both Kia and its external competitors are launching one EV after another.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o4ky1s/hyundai_ioniq_3_ev3_format_but_completely/nj4yzme/,12,positive,0.4351,Product,Battery & Charging,Fast charging praised

To me there's some slight similarities at the B-pillar with a Mazda 3 HB, it has a similar window line that becomes smaller towards the back giving a fat b-pillar, has that EV6 roofline look from Kia and some old Civic HB (2007\~ish) kinda rear / rear light design (minus the pixel light structure). I've had both a Civic 2007 HB and Mazda 3 2020 HB so it's quite funny to have stuff that reminds me a bit when I have been very satisfied owner of both.

I think this rendering looks quite plausible in how it might look, wouldn't be too bad if it ended up like this, sure the concept is much sleeker and expressive but this looks quite realistic though and could be a lot worse, imo this would be better than what the Ioniq 6 concept turned out to be in real life.

* Canadians largely don't buy Canadian-made vehicles. Over 80% are shipped south. Which country holds the Sword of Damocles over the Canadian auto industry? It isn't China.
* The vast majority of vehicles which Canadians actually buy have final assembly in the US, Mexico, EU, Korea, and Japan. It's not our problem if their market share gets displaced by Chinese imports.
* Even if Carney can somehow strike a deal with the US (which could then get violated the next day), the damage is done - investment is spooked by the fatass down south and any prospect of growth went out the window. Plus, when these automakers have a bad year, do you think they'd rather put a Canadian plant or an American plant on the chopping block first?
* Any stability in the Canadian auto industry will be ICE only. The only reason automakers promised EV investments at all was because Trudeau heavily lobbied Biden to make Canadian-built EVs eligible for preferential IRA tax credit treatment. With the IRA gone, there is zero reason to invest in Canadian EV production anymore, even without tariffs.

If the majority of Canadian-built vehicles were actually bought by Canadians, then I would be in favour of protecting the auto industry here.

a BYD ATTO3 (CAR BYD WAS testing before the tariffs got announced) is on average $35K USD globally and we WILL NOT get the post discount CHINA price that is widely published of $16K USD

the RAV4 is safe for NOW and the PHEV version counts as a ""NEV"" under the sales mandate currently ""paused""

Only one force can kill the Canadian auto industry and it isn't China. It's the country that buys the lion's share of Canadian production and currently levies punitive tariffs. Do you think the Canadian auto industry can survive purely on the paltry number of sales in Canada alone? Look up what happened to the Australian auto industry in the mid 2010s for reference...

Arguments about protecting jobs also make the assumption that Chinese EVs would necessarily displace sales of Canadian-made vehicles, which again are the minority of the Canadian new-sales market. But how does anyone know that's the case? After all, EV FUD is very much a thing up north, and the Canadian auto industry is entirely ICE (apart from one piece of shit made in Windsor).

reddit,2025-10-12T04:08:58,TheMannX,"Because right now it still exists and can be redirected towards Canadian consumers at far lower cost in terms of money, opportunities and time than rebuilding an industry from scratch. Canada at one point DID make the vast majority of cars sold in Canada - whole generations of people in places like Oakville, St. Thomas, Oshawa and Windsor bought the GM, Ford and Chrysler products they made. What's changed is the free trade era allowing much greater choices for consumers - not in itself a bad thing, but if it results in the decimation of an industry that supplies tens of thousands of jobs, it does have a serious downside. Once upon a time GM employed 25,000 people in Oshawa alone. Now its about a tenth of that. Some of that is automation, but a lot of it is the cars now being made in Mexico and the United States.

Canada needs to be thinking about the number of good jobs it will have once AI chops limbs off of just about all service industries. This country won't survive 25% unemployment again - Period. It'll destroy itself first, and it wasn't far off of doing so in the 1930s. Unless Ottawa is prepared to turn to socialism in a big way to make people's lives easier - and we know that isn't gonna happen, even with the orange jackass in Washington providing a useful lightning rod for criticism - the only way Canada survives in its current state as a unified nation is to get more good jobs, and that in a AI-worked-over world means value-added industries and manufacturing, and providing as much of our own needs at home as we possibly can. That means ALL industries in Canada that provide for the needs of Canadians need to be protected and expanded to provide additional employment. Furthermore, making more of those goods in Canada, in facilities that are environmentally sound to as great a degree as possible, reduces the amount of carbon emissions these products produce simply because you're not shipping fifteen thousand kilometres from China to Vancouver and then another four or five thousand if they are headed for markets in Ontario or Quebec.

I think Australia made a monumental mistake in not protecting their own industries, but they have far greater natural resources per capita than we do (Canada has much more people than Australia) and their auto market had been up and down for some time before the 2010s. But their situation isn't Canada's. They don't have Trump and the Americans wanting to annex them. They don't have independence movements in two provinces. And its not like they don't have many of the same societal issues - in some ways theirs are worse. As awful as Canada's treatment of its indigenous people has at times been, its a damn sight better than that of Australia.

If EVs are going to dominate Canada's car market and Canada not end up coming apart as a country, they need to be made here. We need to build the industry. Stellantis and Volkswagen-Audi have made major commitments to battery plants. Now let's get them building assembly plants. If the Chinese want to do that, by all means, I don't object to BYD making cars here.

I'm not able to find any sign of subsidy enabling their profit, aside from R&D support, pretty similar to growing companies all over the world. Have a look at Tesla's USA R&D grants as an example.

What I do find is incredibly large and heavily automated factories with as many robots as people, and the people are mostly highly trained technicians and engineers. I also find a well-managed company with an appropriate amount of debt, much like any large, successful company. I also find a company building similar factories in other countries. Does China subsidize those too? I strongly recommend anyone stuck in this line of thinking watch some youtube videos of a BYD car factory.

BYD is a unique player in China's industry in that it is not state-owned. Just about all other major auto manufacturers in China - Dongfeng Group, SAIC Motor, FAW Group, GAC Group and Changan Automobile - are directly owned and controlled by the government in Beijing or by one of its constituent states. Over the last few decades, China's central government has set goals for its companies to meet various targets, many of which are wildly bigger than what their market could demand. EVs weren't the first of this - they did with steel production, electronics, real estate and a bunch of other areas - but their results have had devastating impacts on markets in many places. This is why China has a real estate bubble of ungodly proportions right now that they are trying to tamp down and why their EV production vastly - we're talking by millions of units annually here - outstrips what their market will bear. This is why they want to export them, and why they can so massively undercut the prices of competing products from anywhere else. It's dumping, plain and simple.

Canada doesn't want that. We need good jobs here, not cheap Chinese EVs that might make it three years in our climate before rust starts destroying them. Trading tens of thousands of good jobs for that is a truly shit tradeoff. And for the record, I don't find protectionism as a concept to be all that bad, but it requires intelligent application.

>The challenge of meeting China's manufacturing demands is becoming more urgent. In 2017, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security predicted that major industries, including automotive manufacturing, ***would face a shortage of 30 million workers by 2025***. 

>Compounding the issue, recruitment demand in the new energy vehicle sector has surged by 32% year-on-year in 2023, according to a report from the China Centre for Information Industry Development. Despite this growing demand, China’s vocational education system has struggled to produce enough skilled workers to fill the gap. Meanwhile, university graduates typically steer clear of blue-collar roles, leaving many manufacturing positions unfilled.

Remember when union workers in USA went on strike and got a pay raise? But the agreement was to back burner automation? Union workers got screwed over hard and they didn't even know it.  

Remember the train workers?


>“The solution is that people don’t have to come to work to try to operate trains after they’ve had heart attacks and broken legs. But right now, where we are is caught between shutting down the economy and getting enough ***Republicans to join us*** in making sure that people have access to sick leave.” - Sen.

While it's great, there are many limitations that the manufacturer didn't make clear enough. So it feels like that's the only reason you need to keep driving the Leaf, is because the depreciation hit too hard.

Which means you need to keep driving it longer, than you really want: taking airplanes instead on longer journeys. No way Nissan is going to solve these problems ever, and only in countries like the USA where there is suing culture. They might buy back some of the Leafs, because obviously they are getting sued.

Whereas in Europe? Going to the court is very expensive, so almost no one would do this in their right minds. Instead they just take the coulance of Nissan, if it's already offered?

I have an Ariya and old Leaf and was bumming over not waiting for the new Leaf - but I read that the new Leafs on lots right now are really quite expensive. They have several hundred dollars worth of non-negotiable add-ons by the manufacturer, such as battery heater and CCS adapter, then the dealers are trying to add their crap like paint protection, and there aren't any manufacturer rebates. The window sticker I saw was well over 37K for an SV+ (not even a Platinum). I actually got my brand new Ariya (larger-battery AWD) for less than 30K before tax (it was under 33K out the door including all taxes/fees) because of all the manufacturer incentives and dealer desperation to get rid of it. Nissan definitely marketed the Ariya wrong, and they did a complete 180 on the Leaf.

The amount you are regenerating is most of the time much lower than what you are consuming when accelerating the vehicle. That acceleration consumes a lot of power and that's why highway cruising at a fixed speed is practically more efficient.

Regarding the highway runs at 80 vs 120 km/h: To confirm the numbers we'll need more data for both types of driving. Ideally within the same week. But assuming the numbers you have shared are consistent, there's something wrong with the car. The power consumption at 120 km/h is always higher than 80 km/h, it's just physics. Maybe there are external factors? I would advise you to do more testing.

Is there a gradient going one way or the other? That can also affect the power consumption significantly. Like another comment said, headwinds/tailwinds can also have an impact.

reddit,2025-10-12T04:55:26,LewyDFooly,"EDIT: Another interesting tidbit; OP drives a GAC Aion vehicle, *not* an E-GMP vehicle from Hyundai/Kia. Didn’t know GAC Aion also used the term “i-pedal”.

Interestingly enough, I can tell OP drives an E-GMP vehicle (given their mention of “ipedal”) — same as I do. And frankly, they’re being misled by whatever system they’re relying on for city vs. highway efficiency. The key point here is that those onboard readouts are often far from gospel.

Here’s a real-world example from my first big road trip with my EV6. On the return leg, we charged once. We left the Tampa Bay area at 99% SoC and arrived at a Supercharger with 21% after driving 196.04 miles.

Now, if you took the system’s reported usage at face value, you’d think I used 37.89 kWh — which works out to an absurd \~5.2 mi/kWh. But that’s obviously impossible. The EV6 has an 84 kWh battery, and dropping from 99% to 21% means I actually used somewhere in the ballpark of 60–65 kWh. If I had kept going until the pack was completely empty, I’d likely have gotten \~265 miles of (mostly highway) range.

Compare that to my city driving. I’ve consistently seen real-world range closer to \~340 miles, and my efficiency readouts in stop-and-go traffic often exceed 4.3 mi/kWh — even higher if I enable traffic-aware cruise control.

Ultimately, regeneration efficiency debates are kind of beside the point if the data itself is misleading. These systems are useful for rough trends, but they’re not accounting for the actual energy you’re pulling from the pack. They can simply paint a picture that doesn’t reflect real-world performance at all.

It isn't very useful to compare them because the things they need to do right are probably quite different. One is like air drag, stability, and rolling resistance. The other is maybe regen rate, weight, battery charge and discharge characteristics, and drive train efficiency.

Of course, drag is extra bad. Low CD is for highways, not the corner store. On the other hand, weight should have a linear relationship with energy demand, no? 

Idk if you can easily find that speed in all cases as cars can only go so fast. Plus, the capacity of rubber to grab the road is pretty fixed compared to speed. 

Rubber affects maximum energy generation, too. The regeneration rate is a better way to influence the stop and go efficiency, though, because no one wants to ride around under more than half and G or so.

reddit,2025-10-12T08:45:48,TemuPacemaker,">And that answer probably depends on conditions in each. Assuming good whether all around, if you fix some level of stop and go, then you can try to find a speed where air resistance takes more juice than repeatedly accelerating up to some lowish speed.

While you're absolutely correct about everything, I think in practice 120km/h is just going to use way more energy than any realistic driving in traffic.

The energy requried for driving at 120km/h is 17kW, and 25km/h is 0.5kW. You can waste *a lot* of energy accelerating and decelerating and still come out ahead

Located in Hungary, the new factory is on track to start producing its first vehicles before the end of this year. It is a central component of BYD’s pan-European strategy, with cars being produced in Europe for European customers,”

Everything can break. Everything. Pointing that out doesn't help your opinion... it actually breaks it. :)

Seriously. Suspension systems have been worked on for over a hundred years. NMC has been around since the '70s, LFP the '90s. We have nuclear tipped missles running on 5.25 inch floppy disks.

Do not worry at all if you think it's optimistic. Instead worry about if China doesn't think it is optimistic. We would not be here talking about EVs if China thought otherwise.

Battery, BMS, drive controller, motor, charge port. 

NMC came out in the '70s, LFP the '90s. This is not some new black magic never before seen. This is China spending a lot of time and money and effort making really, really good battery factories. Making the actual EVs is trivial after that. Hence, all the panic.

Henry Ford's wife drove an EV over a hundred years ago. USA could have did what China did at any time. In fact pretty much all this tech was invented in USA. Then Tesla thought EVs were a good idea. Then China.

The only downside to EV longevity is manufacture support and to the cries of most people in this EV sub that is the number 1 reason why Tesla is popular in China.  

No need to hope but if you are really interested lots of articles on it. Hell, go to homedepot.com and read all the reviews on battery powered lawn mowers. 

Keep in mind that a person could put in home solar/battery. For the next 20 plus years they pay nothing to power their home or to power their EV.

The press and the Stephen Miller types say rare earth metals all the time and of course have NO IDEA what they are talking about. Surely they must realize carbon is not a rare earth material. China has focused for many years on the critical step after mining a raw material whereby it is specially refined into a usable product. This became critical during Trump 1.0 when DJT tried to destroy China and exert US dominance. The US market was so critical to China at that time and China had limited responses to balance the playing field. Trump severely damaged the Chinese economy in Trump 1.0 and since he is locked into the past (MAGA) figures the same playbook applies. Now almost 8 years later, China dominates the refinement process of almost all elements of the periodic table. DJT wants a trade war. He doesn't negotiate 'and make deals'. He tries to damage other countries and treat them as adversaries -- make them capitulate through threats and unhinged behavior. Just ask the engineering professionals from Korea who ended up in chains in Georgia. This is his modus operandi. China has worked to position themselves as the material refiners for the whole world. DJT is starting a new trade war we cannot win. I would imagine the only critical material is that which is used to make the orange dye he sprays on in the morning. Carbon (graphite) is hardly rare.

Quote:




Can we expect a preemptive strike against the fascist West by the mighty Global South ?

Lets hope, that doesn't go so far and the West doesn't become fascist. 




These days, the Global South appears to be in an advantageous position vs. the West:




The Global South could now shut down Western economies just by denying access to resources and markets. 




As we know, the West can not have manufacturing and services (the secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy) without the supply of resources from the Global South.




The reality today is, the West faces a number of challenges, among the biggest is managing a transition from a financialized economy to a more balanced economy with a strong manufacturing sector.




The sad story is, Westerners are no longer independent actors, for example, if they want to achieve this transition, the goodwill of the Global South is a prerequisite. But why would the Global South be willing to help the West, let alone a fascist West ?




If the West can't manage this transition the economic, social and political consequences will be severe. As, with the progress of the agendas of the BRICS+ group, the West is threatened with loss of huge income from its gigantic financial sector, linked to reserve statuses of Western currencies and Western control of the global financial system.




Really, the West is finding itself in a very difficult situation. 




As the West declines, the self-confidence in the Global South is growing and growing. In the meantime, the Global South countries have become so powerful, that they can decide, if Western efforts to rebuild their manufacturing sector will succeed or not, just by supplying or not supplying resources and opening or not opening their gigantic markets.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o3xkn2/china_imposes_export_controls_on_lithiumbatteries/nj902mz/,1,negative,-0.8461,Service,After-sales,Service experience

> What China did wasn’t a ban, at least not in name. They called it export licensing. Sounds like something a trade lawyer might actually be excited about. But make no mistake: this was a surgical strike. They didn’t need to say no. They just needed to say “maybe later” to the right set of paperwork. These licenses give Beijing control over not just where these materials go, but how fast they go, in what quantity, and to which politically convenient customers.

> The U.S.? Let’s just say Washington should get comfortable waiting behind the rope line. The licenses have to be applied for and the end use including country of final destination must be clearly spelled out. Licenses for end uses in the U.S. are unlikely to be approved. ***What’s astonishing is how predictable this all was***. China has spent decades building its dominance over these supply chains, while the U.S. was busy outsourcing, divesting, and ***cheerfully ignoring every report that said, “Hey, maybe 90% dependence on a single country we keep starting trade wars with and rattling sabers at is a bad idea***.”

If your electric motor needs to function at high temperatures—and they all do—then mostly it is using neodymium magnets doped with dysprosium. No dysprosium, no thermal stability. No thermal stability, no functioning motor in your F-35 or your Mustang Mach-E. China controls essentially the entire supply of dysprosium, and no, there is no magical mine in Wyoming or Quebec waiting in the wings.

reddit,2025-10-12T10:10:35,AhChirrion,"TL;DR: BYD sold 45% of all the new electrified vehicles sold in Mexico from January to August 2025. And BYD is the eighth most sold car brand in Mexico including ICEV for the same period with a share of 4.5%, between Stellantis in seventh and Ford in ninth.


Interesting. The article says that, from January to August 2025, about 88k new electrified vehicles (BEV + PHEV + HEV) were sold in Mexico.

Back on August 12, 2025, BYD said that it had sold about 40k new vehicles in Mexico since January 2025 - it actually said they just sold 80k new vehicles since their arrival in Mexico on March 2023, but they also previously said they sold about 40k new vehicles from March 2023 to December 2024, leaving 40k new sales for Jan-Aug 2025.

BYD only sells electrified vehicles (BEV + PHEV + HEV) in Mexico.

This means that, of the 88k new electrified vehicles sold in Mexico January to August 2025, about 45% were BYD vehicles.

And adding its 40k vehicles sold to the 834k total new vehicles sold by all other brands in the same period, it results in BYD having about 4.5% of all new car sales in Mexico.

You kid yourself that it wont take decades with the new modular nuclear reactors that theyve been trying to make these things for ages now and it still hasn't happened.  The current batch also actually produce more, not less, nuclear waste than the old type reactors.  So plenty of site remediation design still needs to occur with limited professionals with the technical expertise to design these facilities.

You've fallen for the propaganda.  The big corporations desperately want more nuclear for their AI data centers as they require massive energy.  They've been lobbying for it for a long time now.

It would be astounding if they havent been flooding social media/media with pronuclear  propaganda fo a long time now.

Then why have French energy prices been steadily rising? If renewables are cheaper than nuclear, and nuclear has held steady in terms of generation while renewables have increased 100x over the last 20 years, why are prices climbing?


Same question for when France disabled a bunch of reactors for maintenance. Prices shot up, then decreased when the reactors came back online.


Granted, there's a million variables and I don't expect you, individually, to know all the answers. France is connected to the EU grid, so we can't look at France in isolation.


Obviously, thanks to central banking, inflation is always a factor for rising costs. Not to mention the wild handful of years during COVID.


There's also increased consumption to consider, changes in regulation/legislation, and so on.


But it is interesting to me that France has significantly cheaper prices compared to other, less nuclear Euro nations.


I think there's a lot of misunderstanding and fear around nuclear that subconsciously pushes people away from the concept.

We considered France. It has a cheaper cost for power than most EU nations.


Then, you said France is adding a lot of renewables as if that proved that renewables are cheaper than nuclear.


But. French power costs have done nothing but go up since they stopped building nuclear and switched to adding solar/wind.


I then asked you why are costs going up if renewables are so cheap, but also acknowledged that it is a complex question involving lots of other factors.


Solar/wind are great, but they also are limited. They literally are incapable of supplying steady demand, much less spiking for *on-demand* needs. And, solar is most efficient during the time of day when energy is least needed.


All of that is to say that I think there is a positive role for a carbon free, steady state/on-demand energy source that can last for decades.


Nuclear could, in my opinion, be an environmentally friendly, lower cost option for steady and on-demand supply and I used France as an example of a nation that invest heavily in nuclear power and saw good results.

The [Opportunity Cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp) of building *new* nuclear is so high it is playing directily into the hands of fossil fuels which is why they are lobbying so hard for it in Australia, USA, and Europe.

I agree with the parts that I didn't quote, but I don't agree with your conclusions.  Sure, there will be a short term adjustment from the removal of the subsidy, but past that, EVs aren't getting more expensive or less capable.  Year by year, bit by bit, batteries are getting cheaper, and when sodium ion is ubiquitous EVs will be less expensive up front than ICE and HEV (they're already less expensive in TCO).

The only bright side here is that China makes everything. They want stable geopolitics so they can sell solar panels and batteries and EVs and Walmart products and laptops and phones and air conditioning and chicken nuggets.

I'm not sure that it is. There are 68 models broken out in Cox Auto's report, and only a third (ish) of them are intended for a mainstream audience.

A little over half of the EV models on the market are offered by luxury brands (Acura, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Genesis, Lexus, Mercedes, Porsche, Rivian, Volvo), which are by definition low volume plays. A few are discontinued and selling out dealer stock (Chevy Bolt, Mini Cooper). And a few more are vehicles from mainstream brands that are selling at a sky-high price point (GMC Hummer, Tesla Model S).

Nearly every model Audi or Volvo or Porsche offers in the US sells fewer than 2000 units a month. Those three brands together have 5 models (of 31 offered) which exceed that threshold. 

That graf probably is right for brands like VW or Ford or Nissan, which are more dependent on volume.

Sure, touch screen cost more than buttons.

But this isn't about having buttons OR touch screen.  It's about having BOTH or having touch screen by itself.

Having both costs more, which is why Musk even got rid gear lever.

A single button or a single panel you would be correct. But the cost to design, get molds, source buttons, run wires, and do design iterations on multiple panels is significantly higher than the central touchscreen.

As an example my Ev9 has buttons on the door for memory seats in a panel along with the massage feature and heated/cooled seats. Another panel has buttons for openning/closing the lift gate, the battery door, parking brake release and hood release. Then you have the panel under the touch screen that controls the touch screen navigation. Finally there is another panel under the touch screen panel for climate control. Each of those require their own fit, finish, design, iteration, and such.

 Its not insignificant design cost and once its designed they are locked in. I hate the giant screen to control everything and didn't buy a Mach-E or Tesla originally because of that. However for them it absolutely is a cheaper cost.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o2rbyq/rivian_ceo_tells_people_to_buy_something_else_if/nirkmyq/,1,negative,-0.0634,Product,Battery & Charging,Range mention

Anything that has a human interface needs to be overbuilt to account for humans doing dumb things.  So the actual vent control mechanism costs more on the manual version.

Motorized version adds 4 actuators and associated wiring and fasteners.  Motorized version allows to duct to utilize the entire width of the IP (instrument panel), allowing the ducts to be shorter and less mass.

Manual version requires customer facing registers and stronger fin mechanism.  Manual duct registers cause the entire IP to be taller, which adds mass.  More mass in the vehicle requires for battery to achieve equivalent range.

In the end, motorized version may be a bit more expensive, but allows more styling freedom in the IP.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o2rbyq/rivian_ceo_tells_people_to_buy_something_else_if/nisdly2/,5,positive,0.7825,Product,Battery & Charging,Fast charging praised

So you have to look at the screen. And unlike a switch where you have tactile feedback that your finger is on the right button before you push it, it activates as soon as you touch it. So again you have to be looking down at the screen the whole time. Finally without any haptic feedback there isn't any confirmation that you hit the button the right number of times without looking at the screen. So you have to be looking at the screen. And then if you hit a bump in the road at the wrong time, there is a good chance of mislicking so that takes time to correct. 


Also I adjust the fan more than temp, which can't be done without opening the submenu. Same goes for recirculation since the car seems to like to randomly turn recirculation on.

reddit,2025-10-12T00:17:08,hutacars,"I first drove the P2 3 years ago, shortly after [Tesla ruined their cars](https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/rnz8tr/the_light_show_is_all_well_and_good_but_does/) OTA. I drove it on a whim right after driving an Ioniq 5, expecting to love it, and coming away very disappointed. Since then, plenty of other EVs have launched, and while I haven’t driven all of them by any means, I’ve driven a good number of them, and still none of them have matched the experience of the P2. Mach E Rally came closest, but personally I cannot stand Ford interiors. I have not yet driven an Ioniq 5 N, and it seems that’s the car most likely to jump to the front of the line when I do. The sad reality is I’ve driven gas cars I’ve liked more than most of the EVs I’ve driven (GR Corolla comes to mind). 

The biggest problem is the US— which, TBF, it sounds like you’re not in— mostly just gets shitty SUVs. I drive an Ariya or a Hummer or a Rivian or an iX or a Mach E Select and the seating position is too high, the visibility is too poor, and at least on the cheaper models, there’s a lot of body lean. Even in the Ioniq 5 I was surprised how much lean there was. So the car is already starting at a disadvantage and will have to work to sell me on it, and rarely can. There’s always some obvious indicators that the vehicle was designed by a company whose bread and butter is designing gas cars\*— my biggest bugbear is the presence of a start/stop button— in the form of operational friction that makes it less pleasant to operate than a Tesla. Maybe TACC doesn’t restart from zero. Maybe there’s no OPD. Maybe the regen is weak. Maybe it doesn’t retain your “Sport” drive mode selection between startups. What have you. The biggest game changer Tesla brought to modern cars is respecting the user, both in terms of what the user tells it to do (maximize regen, keep my drive mode) between startups, and in terms of what the user expects (TACC gets the car moving once traffic starts moving, regen works down to 0 MPH), and so few other companies *get* that. 

Meanwhile, the P2 is a proper car, a 4-door liftback. It’s extremely heavy for a car, but manages to hide the weight well. It doesn’t lean, at least with the PP. The power comes on instantly when requested. Regen is strong, stronger even than Tesla whose regen I find a bit weak. And all the little features and settings I mentioned above *just behave* as the user expects them to, which is huge. This makes the car a delight to use, rather than a source of friction. Given everything else on the market, that’s super refreshing, and why even 3 years later, I remain a fan. 

To your point about it being cramped: it’s Chinese. It can fit Chinese people just fine. I am not Chinese, but I am a perfectly average sized American male, and fit perfectly comfortably. My biggest packaging-related gripe was the presence of a single usable front cup holder. 

*Yes, I’ve driven a Lucid and a Rivian R1S. My expectations were admittedly high for both given the reviews. The Lucid unfortunately had a mechanical problem and I ended up having to give it back after just a couple hours, but in that time I was fairly underwhelmed by the interior. The back of the wheel had plastic right where your fingers naturally rest, and it felt bad and creaked badlier. I also didn’t like the infotainment system at all. Poorly laid out interface, the lower screen was too low to comfortably operate while driving, and moving stuff between screens was such a gimmick. I also somehow managed to lock myself out of being able to lower the frunk. The driving experience was reasonable though— good amount of squatting back and pitching forward when getting on and off the power, but that’s a lot more tolerable than body roll. And the Rivian… well, there’s just no getting around it’s a huge 7 seater SUV. It didn’t simply plow forward at least in the same way the Hummer did, which was an improvement, but it’s not exactly nimble. Infotainment seemed to match Tesla’s the closest, though I didn’t have much time to play with it.

It’s sad that they are most likely the first Chinese cars the international customers experience in. Nio, Li Auto, Xiaomi, Zeekr, Xpeng, HIMA all have software and voice control that are leagues above.

Something like “I hate this thing is buried 4 layers deep” would never be a problem, because you can simply ask the car to open up any settings menu that controls the thing you are looking for or simply do it. There’s almost nothing the voice control can’t control in the car. Massaging seat mode/intensity/duration, steering wheel position/weight, air suspension height, drive mode, front-rear power output ratio, HUD height/brightness/content, passenger screen content, windows/blinds/sunroof cover open to a specific percentage, open truck gate to a specific height, you name it.

When I was traveling in the high altitude region, I asked the car to remind me the altitude every 20 minutes, it just does exactly that.

When you want to plug in the vehicle but only wants to start charge at 4:00 am for this one time, you just simple ask the car in a few works “start charging at 4:00 am”.

When you sit in the back and want to watch the same show the front passenger is watching on his screen, you can simply just tell the car to mirror it on the second row screen.

When you need to find the closest rest stop with charging stations nearby and available, the voice control will find it and finishes the route planning under 2 seconds.

When you are curious about a building, mountain you see up ahead, you can just ask the car something like “what’s the mountain on my front right/2 o’clock”, or “what’s that tall building we just passed by on the left”, it will find the exact mountain/building and tell you all the history about it.

The limit is actually what you can imagine that it is capable to do. These voice controls are already at a stage where you can treat it as a real personal assistant that will understand 99% of your requests and complete them faster than any human unless it’s something like “pass me that snack I just bought”, of course.

The thing is you can literally speak most languages to it without any issue because it’s AI-powered.

reddit,2025-10-12T07:18:49,SjalabaisWoWS,"Man, I'd love to sit down at a bonfire with you and chat cars for a full night. Our conclusions might differ, but our approach is similar. In principle, I agree with much of what you said, even though we may conclude differently. 

I want the most perfectly reliable cars above all. Since I've also always owned a classic, my tolerance for unexpected grease, time and expenses for daily drivers is near zero. Build quality and reliability are therefore the factor that allows me to de-prioritise other weaknesses. Throw in a low price and we're on our 2nd LEAF (2012 replaced by brand new '23). Then, my wife was swayed by my MIL and other know-nothing-about-cars-influencers to not buy a 2nd BEV, so we ended up with a PHEV. Demands were a reliable, spacious wagon with ski-through 2nd row, heated seats and steering wheel, as well as a commuteable electric range of 50 km. We will not buy a SUV as long as less lazily designed cars are available. Remarkably, that legitimately left only 2 competitors: The Volvo V90 and Kia Optima. The V90 remains the sexiest car made this side of y2k and I come from Volvo ('71 145, '77 242, '93 245 B230FX), but the V90 is unreliable and costs literally twice as much as the Kia as a five year old used car.

Long story short, the Kia has a shit ton of the user friction you mention. It won't remember heated seats and steering wheel between starts and has the Japanese/Korean sickness of turning off the heated steering wheel after 30 minutes anyway. Here in Norway, this feature needs to be on for eight months of the year, period. You cannot actively choose to drive electric only unless you turn off the heat completely - because there is no heat pump like in Volvos or Toyotas and it relies on ICE waste heat instead. Even with every interventionist ""smart"" feature turned off, the gearbox is the car's weakest user point, as it shifts like a sweaty, tired farmer eager to retire, and it can't handle gravel inclines, let alone ice. A huge Achilles heel here in Norway. Finally, this car has had 22 - that's twenty two - warranty sessions at Kia in the less than three years we've had it. The cost all this would have incurred if it was billed at customer prices instead of 0 cost to us, would be near 25k USD. We bought the car for 17k USD and received about 3k back as reimbursement settlement for all the issues we've experienced, so that's a bloody significant number. In short: I can't wait to replace this one with something that works more as intended, in both meanings; reliability and userdependency.

Coning back to your comment, I appreciate what you say is the largest plus of Polestar. That's also something that you'll mostly learn over time, not necessarily on a test drive alone. That said, we can't change our bodies and the P2 being designed for tiny people only remains utterly egregious to me. *Especially* with them playing on Scandinavian heritage, and Scandinavians tend to come in stretched sizes. I find it very interesting that you can drive the Ioniq 5 and P2 back to back and like the Polestar better, because the Ioniq 5's interior - especially after the revision that replaced the light-plastic-info-unit with something not reflected in the windshield - is just multitudes better designed. It totally disqualifies the Polestar to me, there's no way to ignore it. My kids won't fit in the rear seat. Bam, case closed.

On Tesla, I have driven the TM3 countless times and minimum experienced two phantom braking issues every time. [Our roads are narrow, winding, and often unmarked](https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwM4-TTJK3HbdA8vbNRSKz56lwpxHp5tb). TACC isn't possible to use here, so this all new, supposedly ""smart"" car comes without cruise control. Unacceptable, like the Polestar interior, I can't get past that. Throw in paint and rust issues, blinkers on the steering wheel and a rain sensor that doesn't work without a wiper stalk and that's it. And as I initially said, reliability matters, and Tesla may sell every third new car in Norway, but with customer protection agencies, they keep hovering at about 90% of all car related claims.

When you put your foot down in an Ioniq 5, it ""rolls into"" the power, building up to the max rather than just delivering it upfront. It makes it feel a lot slower than the numbers suggest.

Bad:
The vf9 is noticeably heavier with a larger batter .  It’s slower and a lot more inefficient (I feel by a lot).  Ev9:99kw,350m to vf9:123kw, 291m.
The rear seat accessibility sucks in the vf9.  You feel the large turn radius.  For some reason feels extra ridiculous.

They place a big static console in the middle row so you have to pull this string to get the seats up.  O power option.
Minor software glitches.  Most of it goes away if you wait a minute or two for everything to load and clear.  In ev9, I push the button and go.  If I do the same in vf9, it will go. It I would hear chimes all drive about what’s not available.

The cameras are ok , the ev9 is much better. Randomly changes view later when reversing most of the time I get 360 but occasionally I’ll get the big rear view I never asked for.

Good:

The body roll isn’t great either, but it’s deceiving. The car can handle way more than you think it can from the roll, which takes quite a while to get used to. Definitely could be improved though. 

I don’t understand the problem with auto stop? You can turn it on or off, there’s a button next to the steering wheel. Personally I just leave it on permanently. 

My only experience with Tesla was a model Y RWD that I had, which is the other end of the scale to your model 3 performance. I can tell you the RWD Y has absolutely no violence in its acceleration! That is an unfair comparison of course, but so is the model 3 performance. 

The other things you mentioned there are the opposite of ICE features, they are fantastic EV features that Teslas are sorely missing. Both quite complex though so I guess you wouldn’t understand what they’re doing from a test drive. 

First the drive mode select has a big trick up its sleeve. If you put the car in eco mode, it full disengages the front motor turning the car into a RWD. Why isn’t this possible in a tesla!? This has a dramatic effect on efficiency. Normal mode actually has full power so the difference between spot and normal is just the steering and suspension forming up, plus it swaps the efficiency gauge for a torque meter. 

Then regen, this is a stand out feature for the I5. There are 8 levels of regen if you include those hidden within the auto regen settings. You can increase/decrease with the flappy paddles on the wheel. Of course there’s also one pedal driving too and you can completely turn off regen with the paddles too. On top of this there’s auto regen which using the software to determine what type of road your own and what your proximity is to vehicles and crossing to adjust the regen automatically.

reddit,2025-10-10T12:47:42,tuctrohs,">1\. Can you charge at home and/or work, and is it at a rate that is fast enough to cover your commute?

This should be asked carefully, because a typical driver might overestimate the cost of installing home charging, having heard from somebody who got suckered into spending $15,000 to upgrade their service to add EV charging.  Of all the loads you might add, EV charging is the one that's easiest to do load management on with the result that you should never need to upgrade your service to add EV charging.  Anyone who reads this and thinks that it would be expensive for them to add EV charging should visit r/evcharging to get expert advice on how to do it in expensively. 

Similarly, in a multi-family dwelling, there might be no provision for charging, but over the coming years, we will be adding that.  How easy it is to do and how quickly it gets done depends on the particulars of the infrastructure at a given building, and also on the regulations in the particular jurisdiction, but it can be done and will be done.  One of the good things about renters is that they can move more easily than owners, and so they can move to a place that has EV charging, as more places start to have it and that becomes part of the competition between landlords.

>2\. Is your EV range larger than your daily drive on most days?

Yes, with the possible caveat that longer daily driving is quite practical if you have charging both at home and at work.  And for people who drive for work, e g, Uber drivers, DC fast charging one or more times can be practical if you have idle time at your day or work that you can do in the car, catching up on paperwork between jobs or whatever, while you are charging 

>3\. Do you have unique needs (hauling, towing) that you can't easily overcome?

It's w>2. orth noting that, for one thing, towing a big boat 30 mi to a lake is a non-issue, as is towing a trailer full of trash to the dump or a trailer full of materials from the building supply store.  It's only if you are going on a long distance trip that hauling a trailer becomes a challenge.  

And then another question becomes how frequently you haul a trailer a long enough distance that it becomes an issue.  It may be that you don't want that trailer hauling vehicle to be your daily commute vehicle.  

>4\. Do you have unique driving patterns where you drive short amounts some days and long amounts on other days?

EVs are better at this than some people realize.  If you have a long distance day and come home at 10%, you don't need to be at 80% in the morning if your next day is a shorter distance.  

>5\. What is the differential price in cents per mile driven between any electricity you pay for with a BEV and gas you would have paid for with an ICE, or the combination price for a PHEV?

I'm not sure that people make vehicle purchases based on minimizing cost. If they, did we'd see a lot more small economy cars on the road.  I think it's better to promote EVS as the awesomest driving experience, rather than something you can do to maybe sometimes save $80 a month.  

>6\. On routes you would take outside of your driving range, what's the availability of charging?

This is important, but it's rapidly becoming a non-issue through most of the United States and Europe. 

As far as what other questions should be on the list, how about the question of whether you care about the driving experience?  If you do, EVs make combustion cars seem pathetic.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o2zgue/what_of_us_consumers_are_good_candidates_for_bevs/nirirvo/,17,positive,0.9881,Product,Battery & Charging,Fast charging praised

reddit,2025-10-11T21:45:02,rjr_2020,"Your ability to charge at home/work is a quality thing, not something that is a go/no go part of the decision.  On my first EV, I publicly charged for months while I waited for an install.  

Same with #2.  My rule is that I need my planned usage for the next day doubled in state of charge (SOC).  That way when my day go sideways, I probably will get by, certainly within range to publicly charge.   

For #3, I don't think comparing most EVs with a vehicle really meant to haul is fair.  My daily driver before my EVs was not one that I could or would haul with.  I had a truck to haul with and I still do that for most needs.  I have pulled small utility trailers without any mileage compromise. 

I don't think #4 is really important either as I drive long distances half the week and around town stuff the other half.  It doesn't change my mind.  

\#5 may matter to some but I don't think the electricity vs fuel is the only difference between BEVs and ICEs.  In 50k miles on my Lightning, I've replaced the tires and added windshield washer fluid.  I could not claim the same on my last ICE.  Maintenance is way less for my EVs.

\#6 is not something that even a good researcher can judge.  It took me a month before I had a handle on public charging and knew what I was really doing.  Now with Tesla supporting many manufacturers, it's even more friendly to do but most of my trips are not typical for me so I cannot do this in a forward fashion.  It's worth noting though that I regularly go to a vacation town for time away.  When I started with my first EV, all of the charging stations were non-functional in that town.  I figured it out and charged before I went into the town then charged on the way back out.  I do absolutely look at ABRP when I'm going over 200 miles out, just to get a feel for what's around since I am going to charge somewhere along that trip.  I pay more attention if the choices are thin.  I had a work trip to a remote area and just like the resort town, I charged on the way in and back out of the area.  I was surprised that even food was hard to find there and there was literally 2 gas stations in the area.  They were not 24 hours so my approach probably served me better than many ICE drivers would be served unless they only needed to drive during the day.

None of your points capture my reasons for driving an EV.  I primarily look at my truck as a daily driver that is nicer inside and driving than anything I've been in before.  It's quiet and fully featured.  I had a friend who just bought an ICE truck in the same trim level as mine and paid more than I did.  That excluded the tax rebate I got since that is gone for now.  I also drive the EV for drastically reduced maintenance.  Finally, I love the fact that I plug it in when I get home and when I leave for work, it's full.  I don't have to stop.  I didn't hate publicly charging for those months, I just did things out when I had to charge.

I absolutely would recommend that anyone that commutes more than 25 miles a day or does more than monthly longer trips to get an extended range vehicle (over 300 miles SOC).  I also would recommend that this person really understand the efficiency hit of cold weather.  I lose about 25% of my distance when it's frigid out.  I have plenty of range for what I need to do or I plan to overcome.  As I told someone the other day, stopping after 250 miles doesn't bother me because I don't want to sit that long anymore in a vehicle.  I don't mind spending 20 minutes getting some refreshments and using the facilities.  On average, 250 miles is 3.5-4 hours if I'm not pushing limits the whole way.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o2zgue/what_of_us_consumers_are_good_candidates_for_bevs/nj0978v/,2,positive,0.9934,Product,Battery & Charging,Range mention

>Is your EV range larger than your daily drive on most days?


Only relevant if the answer is no. If yes, most people won't use this as a filtering criterion, they'll use the longest trip they think they're likely to do in a given year.


>Do you have unique needs (hauling, towing) that you can't easily overcome?


Very much depends on distance more than anything else.



>Do you have unique driving patterns where you drive short amounts some days and long amounts on other days?


I don't think this is especially unique. Loads of people drive around town during the week and do longer drives at the weekends.


I think a really big question that's missing is:


>Would you consider the difference between a 5-10 minute stop every 4 hours and a 30-minute stop every 2.5 hours an unreasonable inconvenience?


If no, then that eliminates any range/charging issues. If yes, that can be enough by itself to keep someone in an ICE car.


The other one is: How much are you able/willing to pay for a car up-front / what's the maximum monthly payment you can stretch to?

reddit,2025-10-10T15:29:03,RosieDear,"Definitely lower....if we compare price of owning the car over 5 years.  
(caredge.com lays these out).

Consider that the entire - densely populated - Northeast, has Electric rates of 25 to 35 cents a KWH. So write that off. California also has rates that high, BUT their gasoline is high. Still, if we consider a really good hybrid (many are over 50 MPG), I'm not sure the EV value is there. Let's do the math.

$4.60 a gallon - 50 MPG on Camry, 54 on Prius = about 9 cents a mile.  
Average KWH price = 31 cents - that's 9-10 cents a mile in most cases. The EV usually cost MUCH MORE in  
Original cost  
Depreciation  
Insurance

Also, public charging, especially fast charging, is usually even more expensive. 

We should talk ""households"" when it comes to this entire discussion. About 128 Million households. 

So we basically write off 30+ Million of those in California and certain states in New England. 

If we want to be really rough about it - we'd do this for the entire country.

Average Residential Electric Rate = .18  
Efficiency loss in charging = 15% - so the effective KWH cost into the machine itself is closer to .23 cents.

That's about 7 cents a mile. Public charging is higher, fast charging MUCH higher. The average price of a new EV is $58K.  
The average price of a new Hybrid is MUCH lower, probably about 35K (the typical hybrids cost 25 to 40K with most being in the low 30's). 

The average cost of gasoline is $3.10.   
At 50 MPG, it's a bit over 6 cents a mile.

It doesn't take a financial genius to see, on average, EV's lose the context - by a LOT when it comes to total cost due to higher intial price and more depreciation. Remember, Fuel is one of the lowest costs involved in owning a car.

Being as we are discussing averages - of course SOME people have anecdotal evidence or stories where they say they are saying money. I really do doubt this if they figured everything in, but it's possible. It would be very generous to say that 1/4 of EV buyers/owners are on par with or a little less than good Hybrid owners. 

Frankly, this is why Hybrids are far outselling EV's in the USA. To repeat for the 100th time...for EVs to make sense, we need Electric to be  
1. Renewable - why do it if the Grid is mostly Fossil Fuel? Fewer reasons.  
2. Excess - this brings the price down and allows for off-hours discounts. 

The folks who got a great deal on a Bolt and have off-hours electric at 6 cents a KWH are saving some money. A few people (very few) who have had PV for a long while on their property and who can feed it directly into the car....they are also paying 6 to .10 a KWH, making their fuel cheaper than gas also. 

If we had Chinese (or American!) EV's for 20K things would get much closer independent of Public Charging. The initial cost and depreciation are big factors - as is insurance (on average a good bit higher than Hybrids).

As people have realized these things you have seen the market shift. In the beginning I think people didn't run the numbers....as they say, Pioneers get Slaughtered.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o2zgue/what_of_us_consumers_are_good_candidates_for_bevs/nisdl4s/,1,positive,0.9788,Product,Battery & Charging,Fast charging praised

Every day during my commute I wish i went BEV, but now on a road trip, I am glad I went  PHEV. 

And that's the problem.  I live in an area that has high BEV adoption, but also dense housing. So public chargers are always full. You have to have access to at least lvl 1, and for many in apartments, that's not possible. Energy costs are high here, so workplace chargers are popular, non-existent or stupid pricey (saw a Lvl2 charger asking for almost 0.60$ a KW). Reliably and conveniently being able to charge overnight is the first hurdle. Figure  that out, and you can handle the day-day to usage. 

The second problem lies in geography. The US is big and the road trip is ubiquitous. A 300mi range (on the low end) is no big deal in an ICE when the process of refueling it takes minutes and you have to work to find an area without gas in any 50mi radius. That means even the most secluded of locations are viable. That very quickly breaks down for a BEV. This becomes even more of an issue for those that are towing. 

Which brings me to a rant with Tesla. They took money from the other major OEM to open the network for non-Tesla vehicles with adapters or even native NACS ports, but they still. Keep about 30% of their network exclusive, and it's not limited to locations such as their properties. A non-Tesla can't charge at any Tesla SC in Flagstaff for example. Or at all in states such as South Dakota. Small towns outside of National Parks are also frequently off limits, even though they have Gen 3+ chargers. 

So the answer to that one yearly trip where the BEV is difficult, one solution would be to rent a vehicle. Go look at rental fees, Turo host behavior and Hertz AI scanners. A 2500mi road trip might cost you 625$ in lease overage miles, but that's less than a week worth of time in a rental, and that assumes no bullshit fee afterwards. 

So solve the day to day charge issue. Then make the road trip work. Then you'll see widespread BEV adoption.

reddit,2025-10-10T14:17:38,LRS_David,"I'm going to flip your question. Why are people NOT good candidates for an EV.

Mostly it is a state of mind.

Step one, people need to forget about ""filling up the tank"". It leads to many many concepts of driving an EV that just don't make sense. If you drive 50 miles a day for work and can only L1 charge 35 miles at night so what. You're loosing 15 miles a day. On a car that likely has a 200 to 300 mile or more range. So you're fine. But many people can't see it that way. You ""fill up"" on weekends.

Anti EV folks tend to come up with edge cases where an EV will not work for 1% of the population. Then claim it will impact 1/3 or even 2/3s of the population. And facts don't matter to them.

I just bought a KONA EV. But I will admit that if I could not charge at home, I'd have had a great pause in buying it. Especially since the number of DCFCs near me isn't great. 6 or 8 within a few miles. And they cost about the same as gas. That 24 station Tesla Supercharger location 1/2 mile away doesn't support non Teslas. :(

Then there is the FUD that you need a 40 to 60 amp charger in the garage and can't afford spending $2K to $10K for the electrical upgrades for such BEFORE installing an EVSE. I was somewhat in this mindset till I bought my EV and learned the reality of typical driving and that a 20 amp circuit would do me just fine. 95% or more of my charging happens while I sleep. And there's load management for even better setups. But many (most?) electricians don't have a clue about such things. (I had to make my EV decision in a hurry after my previous very nice car was totaled in an accident so I was learning ""on the fly"".)

reddit,2025-10-10T18:43:28,Cultural-Ad4953,"I did the math and it definitely works for me, but honestly I did forget in the very beginning to consider the waste electric (as best I can tell it's about 11%). I also drive my vehicles for a long time....my goal with my Mach-e is 10 years or 250,000 miles, so I'm a little less worried about depriciation than most (as long as the vehicle doesn't get totaled or have a castrophic mechancial failure before then). I didn't really like most of the PHEVs, but this got me curious, so I looked....and it turns out that the Kia Sportage PHEV looks like something I might have bought, and instead I went for a Ford Mustang Mach-E. The Sportage is very similarly priced, so clearly the MME ""wins"" that battle because the per mile cost is less for the Mach-E. So I looked at the regular hybrid, which is about $8,000 less. So, that's about $800 less a year OR 3.2 cents less per mile for cost. Now, fuel cost, which I used 38 MPG for the Sportage and 3.7 m per KW for my Mustang Mach-E. When I compare the current price of gas and the price of my electric (including waste), I save 3.9 cents per mile. When I net that difference, I'm saving $9,800 over 250,000 miles. Next is maintenance. Caredge says that the Sportage will have maintenance cost of $8400 over the first 10 years, and the Mach-e will have maintenance costs of $5,400, so an additional savings of $3,000. Next I compared the cost of a Sportage Hybrid and a Mach-E for insurance. The Mach-E is $370 cheaper annually according to Grok. So, when I put it all together, that's a savings of about $16,500 in total, or $1,650 per year. Now, there are some assumptions and unknowns here. I could do much worse if I can't keep the car for at least 5 years or my electric goes crazy expensive or I wasn't able to charge at home. I could also do much better if the price of gas goes crazy high or drive even more.

If you remove original cost, depeciation and insurance differences...well, that's an ""anecdotal"" comparison, not relevant to the average. That's why I like to use average. For ever 250K miles person there are plenty of 50K miles folks. It's anecdotal also, but I notice a lot of people with EV's seems to upgrade more often. Again, we'd need to get the actual facts.

Ah  
**""Available data indicates that U.S. electric vehicle (EV) owners do upgrade their cars more often than owners of gasoline-powered vehicles""**

I think we'd be generous to say that - considering every criteria - even 1/4 of EV owners save money and likely only 5-10% anything worth counting (like you do).

As you see in Caredge, a more normal situation is EV's (Model Y, best seller) costing 20-25K more than other cars over 5 years)....

Whatever the end results cost, until EV's come down to the same price as Camry, etc - I don't think folks buy they to save money. If they did, the average price wouldn't be so high! There has to be other drivers - namely  
First-Tech Movers, Ego (Fad, if we want to call it that).  
Green (proven otherwise now considering our Fossil Fuel Grid).  
or - the old Car Reasoning - I WANT ONE.

Government Policy was pushing REALLY big, so we can't discount that. A lot of people believe what the government says....unfortunately the government never really addressed the ""we don't have excess and cheap and renewable electric"" part of the equation - they put the cart before the horse.

Of course I have zero doubt that the future - eventually - will be mostly electric. It will also be mostly autonomous (eventually) and likely multi-occupancy.

The answer in a lot of places is happening....faster and faster charging-not for people that can charge at home, but for those cases where charging at home is not practical and they truly need to replace the gas station. The problem is that public charging is expensive-if you put a charger on a piece of property, you want to get your money back, so there's a markup associated with that public charging.

Also, I didn't mention my state's EV fee, it's $110 a year, but I'm grandfathered in and won't pay that until 2032.

I grew up with a father who built houses as a GC second job. And have always been interested in how homes are done around the country as I traveled and lived in multiple states. Where I grew up, what you describe is rare. But I can see if as somewhat more often in other areas. And there are places like row houses in Baltimore and similar where issues arise getting power from your panel to where you park.

Each case can be different. I'll agree. But step one for anyone who might think of an EV is drop the concept of filling up at a gas station as a base line. It may not work for you. But it does work for a lot of people.

> and freeze my rear off at an charging station

This isn't how charging works.  Unlike a gas pump, you are outside the car for 10 seconds at most to plug in and 10 seconds to unplug. There are no fiddling with credit cards waiting for the card to run and saying ""no"" to the car wash, etc. No fuel to select, no missing gas lever to hold the pump on, etc.   The car itself is warm and you can leave it running, unlike gas.

> An 3kw charger can at least charge enough that someone who commutes

With my Model 3, 3kW will add 144 miles/day.  On my eTron it will add 94 miles/day.  That is a lot of mileage.  I've run both of those off a single 110V plug for a month without issue.  The eTron did need to be DCFC charged 2x times that month.  80% of people are in this position.  People just don't typically drive more than 40 miles/day.

reddit,2025-10-11T18:40:25,spinfire,"Let me try to give you a bit more detail about why the answer is no for me, since I do think you're engaging in good faith with this sign approach.

When I'm using DC fast charging, I'm on a trip. My charging stops are 8-20 minutes, and I avoid any locations which have any reputation for queuing. I take a lot of road trips, but in 3 years of driving this car I've waited in line twice and the wait was less than 10 minutes each time. Let's consider some of the things mentioned:

> Vacuuming the carpets

My car is utterly packed full of stuff during most road trips. You're not going to get much carpet vacuuming done in 10 minutes. The whole trunk carpet is not gonna be accessible. You could get some footwells, but we also have stuff in them, stuff people were using that have gotten up for approximately as long as it takes them to go to the bathroom and maybe grab a snack. They don't want their stuff moved around. I vacuum the carpets myself BEFORE packing everything in.

> Checking tire pressure and adding air if needed

All modern cars are required by law to check the tire pressure continuously and this has been true throughout the era there are EVs for sale. So checking tire pressure is not useful. Adding air? Again, I do this if I needed to as part of trip prep. If I really needed to add air enroute then I'm usually charging at a truck stop which has air.

> Refilling windshield washer fluid

I always top this off before a trip. It's extremely simple to do. I definitely would not pay someone to do it for me.

> Wiper blade replacement

I don't want to pay someone else to do this. It is very simple to do yourself.

You’re absolutely right that for someone who mainly uses Superchargers on road trips, the timing and context are very different. You’ve got a routine, the car’s packed, and everything’s prepped before hitting the road makes total sense that quick maintenance wouldn’t add much value in that scenario.

Where I’ve been seeing interest, though, is more from **local, everyday users** — people charging near home, at work, or during errands. A lot of them don’t have access to easy air pumps, vacuums, or even shaded parking where they can comfortably do small maintenance tasks. With the number of EVs growing and chargers now being shared across brands, local stations are starting to see more traffic and wait times creeping up. For those folks, a quick convenience service while they’re waiting feels worth it.

That said, your feedback is super valuable it highlights a clear distinction between **road-trip users vs. local chargers**.

However, this only true of the current going into the battery itself. You need to get that power from somewhere - from the power grid. The power needs to be converted to the right voltage, and rectified to from AC to DC. There's no magic bullet or free lunch here, you're not increasing the supply voltage to your home, so you'll still need to pull the same current at the same voltage to get the same power. Because the voltage in to your charger doesn't change, just the voltage out of it.

Furthermore, when you're charging at home, you're using your cars onboard charger, where your car is just taking straight up grid power and converting it to the right voltage for your car's battery. Your EVSE won't know the difference. When you're DC fast charging, the power conversion box is external to the car, and is hooked straight to the battery, instead of going through an onboard charger.

reddit,2025-10-12T01:24:57,theotherharper,"Ther are good reasons why America does not electrify railroads, but those reasons are mitigated by modern battery tech.  

One is just mechanical issues. The wire has to be VERY high to clear double-stack container trains and special loads e.g. Thiokol  Shuttle/SLS booster segments (so build them in Virginia and float them to Florida, duh. Task Utah to building HIMARS rockets). Tunnels were hard enough to clear for double stacks, electrification would require massive work since you can’t have the wire 12” above the top of container. (At least not ENERGIZED wire, read on).  

The other big reason is the terror of relying on external public utilites for electricity.   Becuase those utilities could need to shed some load and go ""hey railroad, reduce your demand by 500MW or get cut”.  They just can't be in that situation. 

Anyway battery tech amazingly takes care of all that. To grossly oversimplify for illistration… think of it like, all over the system, you have batteries tied to trolley wire and to ground,  and trolley float voltage == battery 100% voltage. Simple as that.  You have substations pumping power into the system to keep it at float voltage. 

Some of the batteries are on the locomotives.   You can easily have gaps, like the Detroit Woodward Ave light rail, where you are only under wire a percentage of the trip.  and under all those low tunnels and bridges you either lower the pantograph, or have dead wire.

Do you even want full battery near the top of the mountain where the tunnels tend to be ? No you don’t!   You'll need to hold room for regen. So you may not need trolley on the hill at all.  

Other batteries are at lineside, being battery substations, something Sacramento light rail has.  When loads are not heavy, they take off the trolley to charge themselves.  When loads are heavy, they discharge back to the trolley to support nearby trains.  These batteries mean that **actual power-generating substations don’t need to be large enough for local peaks, only system averages**.  That makes them a lot smaller.  

And that makes it viable for the railroads to own their power generation, which remove the objection of someone taking their power away from them.   They become a ""cogenerating"" supply where their own needs come first, and they are willing to send surplus to the grid.  The grid knows how to deal with it.  

The batteries everywhere also take ALL the ""bouncy-bouncy” out of the railroad’ electrical load to the grid.  You don't have the situation like on BART where suddenly the tiny town of Orinda, CA is pulling 12 MW from the grid because 2 trains are accelerating out of Orinda Station at the same time.   And the rest of the time the town pulls 1 MW.  Utilities do not like that, and they don't want your regenerative braking either.   But if you have your own batteries to dump it into, chef's kiss.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o2n0op/caltrains_brakes_feed_power_back_to_the_grid_and/nj1884k/,2,positive,0.9482,Product,Battery & Charging,Battery mention

reddit,2025-10-12T14:15:21,tuctrohs,"My understanding of the reason for 25 Hz is different.  That was the era when we were beginning to get interconnections at 60 Hz, but it was still a crazy mix of frequencies, with lower frequencies better for the motor tech of the time and higher frequencies better for minimizing flicker in lighting.  And DC still in use as well.  Lighting systems had been in the 130 Hz range, and motor systems were often in the 15 to 30 Hz range.  60 Hz was chosen for dual-use grids as a compromise, with that number chosen by Westinghouse, with the concept to standardize on 60 for general purpose and also use 30 Hz for systems that were primarily or exclusively for large motors, including streetcar systems, which were a major electric load at the time in the region.  As a point of reference, the ancestor of the NJ electric utility PSEG, was a streecar+electric+gas utility.

The specific 25 Hz number had it's origins in the Niagara Falls/Buffalo system:

>The first generators at the Niagara Falls project, built by Westinghouse in 1895, were 25 Hz, because the turbine speed had already been set before alternating current power transmission had been definitively selected. Westinghouse would have selected a low frequency of 30 Hz to drive motor loads, but the turbines for the project had already been specified at 250 RPM. The machines could have been made to deliver 16+2⁄3 Hz power suitable for heavy commutator-type motors, but the Westinghouse company objected that this would be undesirable for lighting and suggested 33+1⁄3 Hz. Eventually a compromise of 25 Hz, with 12-pole 250 RPM generators, was chosen. Because the Niagara project was so influential on electric power systems design, 25 Hz prevailed as the North American standard for low-frequency AC. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_frequency#25_Hz_origins)

We can trace that to the PRR adoption through the use of 25 Hz in the New Haven railroad:

>The New Haven had considered two different operating frequencies for use in their electrification: 15 Hz, and 25 Hz. Although 15 Hz was desirable from an engineering perspective, as it would afford a reduced motor size, lower inductive losses, and a higher motor power factor, choosing that frequency was viewed by the railroad as akin to a ""break in gauge"", thus limiting the commercial prospects of their system. 25 Hz had by 1907 already become a commercial standard, and the railroad already operated a number of trolley power houses at 25 Hz and had equipped many of its shops with 25 Hz motors; thus, the railroad selected the 25 Hz standard. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrification_of_the_New_York,_New_Haven_and_Hartford_Railroad#Frequency)

reddit,2025-10-09T13:46:41,Mabnat,"I make audio amplifier ICs for mobile consumer devices.  Wiring the speakers out of phase is a common error that I’m asked to help troubleshoot when customers ask for support.

Part of the problem is that a lot of the engineers for these systems only work on one part of the complex multi-part systems at a time, and you might have multiple engineers working on one circuit.  One guy captures the schematic of the circuit, another does the layout for the circuit board, another person designs the wiring diagrams and connector pin outs, and yet another guy tests that part of the system.

When the single speaker circuit makes it to the prototype stage, it would sound perfectly fine by itself even if the speaker is out of phase.  It’s not until the entire system is connected that an out of phase speaker would cause problems when it starts cancelling out the sound from the other speakers.  Each speaker sounds perfect when played alone, but it sounds bad when they’re all playing together if any are out of phase.

Usually someone figures out why the sound quality is poor pretty quickly, but that’s almost always because the person who figures it out has dealt with this problem before.  For some reason, it’s not easily solved - or even noticed - by novice engineers.  I get support requests from these new engineers, and after they see what happens the first time as soon as they swap the wires, they know exactly what is wrong going forward.  The new guys usually blame our parts or the speakers for the reduced sound quality until they realize that swapping the speaker wires completely fixes their problem.

When you turn one of the speakers in your system into a noise-cancelling speaker instead of an additional driver, it’s going to sound bad.  It’s most noticeable at the lower frequencies, so when it’s the subwoofer that’s wired backwards, it really makes the whole system sound like crap.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o24lzm/kia_ev6_owners_are_rewiring_their_subwoofers/nilgkva/,199,negative,-0.9718,Service,After-sales,Service experience

I am pretty sure „getting it out into the world“ is ultimately KIAs job. Meridian probably had a bunch of prototypes to work with, wired them correctly, and they sounded perfectly. They handed a working system over to KIA, according to their agreements and specifications, and the deal was done. Then KIA fucked it up in their manufacturing process. 

The question is: is there a need for *suppliers* to check the part they provided once more in the cars that leave the factory, and where do you draw the line and how do you organize that? There are hundreds of suppliers involved in creating one car, after all.

This is disingenuous.

If you ban every option except one, then it is, de facto, forcing you to buy that one option.

What is a business in a ZEZ-F supposed to do? Stop getting shipments of their product? Of course not. So, now, they *have* to buy an electric freight vehicle. And remember, these businesses were established long before the ZEZ-F existed, so you can't claim they knew what they were getting in to.

Look, I love EVs. My family has been BEV only for over 3 years. But this kind of bald-faced lying isn't going to win over people on the fence about EVs. It just gives ammunition to people who dislike EVs. They can point to comments like this and say, ""See? Not only are they mandating EVs and forcing you to buy them, but they are lying to your face about it!""

Just own the situation.

Also, just because you don't see a loop of wire on a controller like that doesn't mean the functionality doesn't exist - [it might be inside the controller](https://i.imgur.com/QH9k55c.png).

Another thing is with ebrakes, there is a non-regenrative way to do it [by shorting the phase wires together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GsLPx06_MVA).

reddit,2024-09-05T08:13:52,IronMew,"> Every QS-S4 style throttle most likely is paired with a controller that has one

I used to think the same, but the last few I've dealt with haven't had the wire limiter. I think they've stopped using it due to EU bullshit reasons, even on controllers that use QS-S4/TF100 dashboards.

However, I concede that I wrote that part of the page in an excessively exclusive way. I intended for it to dissuade noobs from opening their lid and getting all the ratnest out looking for a wire that doesn't exist, but that's no excuse for factual inaccuracy so I'll be correcting it.

See what I meant about constantly finding stuff to fix? :D

>  there is a non-regenrative way to do it by shorting the phase wires together

Shorting the wires together will cause braking - actually a whole lot of it - but isn't doable long-term because it follows the same principles: the motor is still running as a generator, only the energy it's producing is being kept in the motor itself as heat. Keep it shorted on a downhill and you'll cook the windings *very* rapidly.

> I'm almost certain my Laotie L6 uses this method, as no amount of braking even in extremely steep hills ever increases the voltage reading

I can tell you my L6 Pro does do ""regen"" because the hardware voltmeter - when it still had it, before the Big Rewiring - did actually jump up when e-braking. I haven't tested with the meter in the dashboard yet, but I think it has a much lower refresh rate.

I'd be *extremely* surprised if your L6 didn't do the same.

>  there is a noticeable delay between pulling the lever and it actually starting - time it needs to wait to make sure the drive is first disconnected.

Mine does the same and I find it so irritating I'm considering adding switches to the brake levers so I can disable e-braking for conditions when the delay is unacceptable, like offroading.

The weird part is, I can hear the motor drive whine doing *something* before it engages the brake: in-between pulling the brake and it actually engaging the motor generator there's about a second when it does a strange buzz - so it's not just an arbitrary delay added in firmware.

At a mildly educated guess I think it's due to the dumb sensorless nature of the controllers - I'd wager they need some time to figure out where the rotor is by reading coil EMF. But then I have a controller that's just as dumb and sensorless in my Speedway Mini4Pro and the delay - while present - is much shorter.

Maybe we just have shit controllers :D I'd almost be tempted to swap them out for smart sensorless/sinewave ones, or even biting the bullet and getting a dual VESC setup, if it didn't mean redoing all the wiring once again, and I just don't have that sort of patience at the moment.

I might actually bother the Endless Sphere people to get an answer to this, as it's been puzzling me for a while.

> on a big enough motor the current induced would be enough to just instantly lock it and throw the rider off the scooter.

A dead short would do this on any scooter. I know because it happened to me on my old ES2 - before I reinforced the controller I managed to blow the traces while braking, the MOSFETs stuck shorted and the sudden wheel-lock would have caused a good tumble if I hadn't been prepared to jump off. Considering how much lower-powered the ES2 motor is compared to the L6, that's another reason I'm 99% sure your L6 doesn't dead-short the motor for braking.",https://reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/1f8x0at/we_have_a_wiki_also_derestriction_threads_are_no/llljoxr/,2,negative,-0.9838,Product,Battery & Charging,Range mention

> It works on low powered motors to just increase resistance greatly - on a big enough motor the current induced would be enough to just instantly lock it and throw the rider off the scooter.

That WOULD be non-regenerative (the braking load becomes the stator resistance and all the energy appears in the stator which incidentally is going to get hot really fast and start smoking), but with a dead short characteristic current will flow and on pretty well any scooter direct drive motor, that will be a violent torque and just seize up brutally. If the drive tire is in the rear it will skid and you will fish and jackknife all over the road. In the front, it will probably turn the scooter into a rider catapult (one reason I am not a huge fan of FWD, if you ever have an inverter kaboom and it turns into a short circuit, or there is a bug/oversight and it freaks in a way that involves driving out a constant zero vector, you could get launched).

If you were to address this by PWMing between the low-impedance zero vector (all highsides OR all lowsides ON at once) and a high-impedance state (all devices OFF at once), it becomes regenerative, because the antiparallel diodes become the only possible current decay path during the off-time for the currents building up in the stator during the on-time and rectify that current back into the DC bus. This is exactly how the ""special case braking modulation"" works in SimonK (and most if not all other such stone age gear used to this day in hobby, robot, tool, drone and RC things).",https://reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/1f8x0at/we_have_a_wiki_also_derestriction_threads_are_no/llvys8r/,2,negative,-0.9508,Product,Software & Display,App/OTA mention

As you can see in my video, it doesn't. It's still easy to turn by hand with the windings shorted, so when you have 100kg of scooter and human on top it has no chance. Granted that example is using a smaller 350w rated motor, but the principle is the same with the L6 - I've tested it.

Charge time is really fast, around 3-3.5hrs to go from 20% to 90%. I have the secondary dc charger as well which drops the time to about 2.5hrs. More range would be good, I get around 20-22km using 70% of battery depending on route and wind conditions. It also cuts the top speed depending on remaining battery. For example of I have it set to 45kph top speed and the acceleration profile set to energy saving, I will only get 33-35kph when the battery is around 35%.

I do wear a helmet, elbow and knee pads, plus leather gloves. I've gone down 3 times on my scooter 🛴 all at slow speeds, luckily under 10mph, but it still hurts when you hit the pavement at any speed. keep in mind the older you are the more it hurts, believe me!  I've been riding on 2 wheels of some type all my life, as well as roller skating and skate boarding. I only mention 
these things to point out I've been doing balance sports  my whole life and would recommend to anyone your age or mine the following advice. DON'T ride faster than your willing to fall, because you will go down! Nobody, and I mean nobody escapes going down if your riding 2 wheels. I personally would not have started riding an e-scooter at 81 or 41 for that matter without lots of miles of experience under my belt on 2 wheels--------Oh bullshit!!

reddit,2025-10-13T18:12:37,funcentric,"Thanks for taking the time and effort to post about yourself to provide context. Too many people post here and simply say they want a 30mph scooter that goes 30mi for $400. 

The weight capacity will be a big one unfortunately and as you may have guessed, the range will be lower. Budget ones will be 20mph and 20mi for someone of lower weight, so you'll have to expect less for something under $700-800ish. 

Good to hear that you value the company and reliability and not just looking to buy crap from Amazon. If it's a toy and not to break the bank and isn't a big commitment, then personally that sounds like sub $700 to me. But you may have to spend significantly more to get an overspec'd scooter just b/c of the required load. 350lbs is quite a lot for a scooter. I normally would recommend the Inmotion Climber and give you a discount using my code, but that tops out at just over 300lbs. you may need to stretch your budget closer to $1,000 or more to get over the weight limit issue even if your range and hill requirements are minimal.",https://reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/1o5qy84/completely_new_budget_recommendations/njbahfa/,1,positive,0.8503,Product,Battery & Charging,Range mention
reddit,2025-10-13T19:03:48,pyrotechnicmonkey,"I would say slightly under 1000 can get you something that can go about 35 mph with maybe 20 miles of range. The only thing is at that price point. You are sacrificing a little bit of build quality and stuff like hydraulic brakes or hydraulic spring suspension.  If you can, I would say definitely try and get hydraulic brakes at a minimum since they make maintenance and repair long-term much less of a hassle. The suspension is also nice to have especially if you’re a heavy rider. 

If you can stretch your budget between 1200 and $1600, it is sort of the best price point at the moment in terms of what you get for price to performance ratio. Below that you’re sometimes making critical compromises and above that you start to get into the enthusiast market where the priority is top speed/performance. 

So if you’re gonna be choosing around $1000, I would target something like the  ausom dt2 or the kukirin g3 pro. 

If you can stretch your budget and target maybe 1500 I would lean towards something like the  Teverun fighter mini pro. I think it’s got a lot of improvements that make it a fairly ideal weight for the amount of power and range that you get. Small touches like the removable plugs for the motor and tubeless tires means flat tires shouldn’t be as much of an issue and if you do have a problem, it should be easier to repair. 
I actually tried a friends fighter mini and I liked a decent bit. And I recently ordered one for a family member so i’m going to try it out and if I like it, I’m most likely gonna buy a second one replace my current scooter. I encourage you to look at reviews to see if it’s something you think would fit your needs. Rk9rides has a good YouTube channel where they review a 10 of options at different price brackets. They are usually pretty fair and give you good real world test about possible range and quality of life features.",https://reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/1o5qy84/completely_new_budget_recommendations/njbkytc/,1,positive,0.9939,Product,Battery & Charging,Range mention

I’m under 300, just from experience as a bigger guy going up ~10% above what I “need” tends to lead to decreased wear and tear. Though at the same time a very reliable brand you can often take their weight capacity at face value.

I’d likely want to be under 1000 but if there’s just an option where it’s like “This thing is bulletproof and the company really stands behind it” that’s 1250 I’m not gonna discount it as an option.",https://reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/1o5qy84/completely_new_budget_recommendations/njbeymj/,1,positive,0.7227,Pricing,Affordability,Price perception

reddit,2025-10-13T19:19:36,pyrotechnicmonkey,"You’re probably just misunderstanding how batteries work. As the battery used to grade, they will no longer reach their full charge. This translates to less range because they will drain quicker, but it also typically means a bit of reduced performance because peak power is available when the battery is fully charged. Unfortunately, cheap scooters tend to use cheap batteries where the cells don’t have as long of a life. The controller simply processes the power it is given by the battery. Unless your controller is actually damaged, I have very much doubt changing it will do anything at all for the performance. If you put on new tires if they have a different rolling resistance, or they have a different tread pattern and that could lead to reduced performance. You could try spinning your wheels by hand on a chair. That could let you see if maybe the brakes are rubbing or if the bearings have more drag or friction than normal.

The only thing I can think of it anywhere close is maybe something like the Emove cruiser V2. I think by focusing on a single motor with a bigger battery makes sense. So I think they could probably get it done by shrinking the frame a bit and going for a smaller battery. 

I think the closest is going to be something like the  Teverun fighter mini. Still a bit more weight, but I think the extra speed and battery size are worthwhile. I have always found about 75lbs to be about the maximum weight that you get the best performance and range per pound

The closest thing is really the Vsett 8 at right around 55 pounds. And that goes about 25 mph but with a solid tire.

reddit,2025-10-13T03:17:29,pyrotechnicmonkey,"I’d say you’re in a bit of a tough spot. Being right under $1000 really limits your options. Getting a solid 30 to 40 mph speed is not too difficult but other things like suspension battery and breaking system begin to suffer as things that get cheap out on.  

I personally would never get anything with a no brand battery. It would be LG or Samsung for me if I want anything that has a hope of being reliable. The suspension might not be the best, but if it functions, it’s not a big deal. The big thing I have problems with the mechanical disc brakes.  Those mechanical brakes are extremely cheaply made and are a pain and I have to adjust and keep up with as the pads were out. You have to keep tightening the cable adjustment as the pads lose material. 

At a minimum I would try and get something with hydraulic brakes, which is a little bit tougher without getting close to 1300 or $1500. If you can afford to wait a little bit longer and save up, this scooter seems to be kind of at a sweet spot at the moment. 
I actually kind of bought one recently for a family member. But that was after trying, went out for a little bit at a local group ride. It feels pretty good although I did didn’t get to test out wobbles at high speed. It really seems to be a sweet spot for having a namebrand 25 amp power battery at 60v. The motor seems good quality with tubeless tires and the hydraulic brakes seems sufficient. The frame looks well built. And it uses KKE suspension, which is supposed to be a tier above what most scooters use at least in the past year or so. Kukurin it’s supposed to be decently reliable, but nothing crazy. They are generally focused on affordability, but that can sometimes mean certain corners cut and less premium features like removable plugs for the motors and better wiring that make easier maintenance in the future.  

To sum it up I hate to say it because it’s so easy to tell someone else to spend more money but $1000 gets you I think a little bit too close to what you currently have in terms of performance or quality. And I think if you get something there, there’s gonna be a lot of drawbacks in terms of build quality and a long-term reliability. I really hope that helps. Even something like the blade mini ultra can be a good option, depending on where you live. Because that has hydraulic brakes and a bigger higher voltage battery for not much more money. The only downside with that one is the use of tubes in the tires, but that may be a sacrifice needed to stay at a reasonable budget.

Gf and I got them a couple weeks ago. Yes. If you have the means, 100%. We’re up past 200km already lol.

We have a great trail system in our city so they’re great to get around, tons of fun. Just this weekend we took them to some tame mountain biking trails and they ripped through there, it’s on one of our favorite routes so we’re definitely going back.

There’s definitely some other good ones in its price class from other brands, but this was my favorite out of what I found. I’ve heard mixed things about KUKIRIN but build quality seems really good, it was packaged really well (double boxed), shipped fast, and kukirin has warehouses in Canada to keep parts.

Overall, we’re super happy with them. Of course time will tell the true story of how good of a purchase it is, but my initial thoughts (in no particular order) are:

EDIT: Brakes were a bit lackluster out of the box but after adjusting they are pretty good. I see why people like hydraulic brakes, but I’m happy with these for now. They won’t be my first upgrade.

1. You really don’t need much more power than this. The thing is crazy. It’ll go (what I consider to be) scary fast and climb anything, the dual motors are something else.
2. Super happy with the battery so far. I’ve planned my routes at 35 km or less and been fine riding at 20-30 kph.
3. I read the specs, but it’s a bit bigger and heavier than I expected. Manageable, but considerable. Stairs are a bit of a pain.
4. Suspension is a bit more stiff than I was expecting. Going to find the tool to loosen it up a bit, hopefully that results in some more travel. I’m 175lbs, maybe 185 loaded up.
5. The light points up at people’s eyes but you can just grab the bracket and bend it down.
6. The handlebars are just narrow enough to fit through doorways and I appreciate that lol.
7. Honestly I think deck could be a bit bigger. It’s not uncomfortable, but it requires a certain foot placement.
8. Tires are sweet, the off-road trails we did had packed dirt, some gravel sections, leaves, and some sections with roots. They’re fairly quiet on the asphalt too.
9. The stem latch is very sturdy, It doesn’t wiggle at all and I’m not initially concerned about it failing.
10. The chargers feel a tiny bit cheap compared to what I would expect from a scooter with this price tag, but it seems like it’s a trend through most brands so it may be hard to avoid. I haven’t had any and don’t foresee any issues.
11. We’re both around 5’10” and we don’t have issues with height, but if I was 6’2” or taller I might not consider this scooter.",https://reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/1o58868/should_i_invest_in_this_scooter/njdj5s9/,2,positive,0.9976,Product,Battery & Charging,Fast charging praised

NIU gives me the impression that its a higher quality brand than Kukirin (who can't even get their naming right, Kukirin vs Kugoo Kirin, Kugoo). keep in mind there is no app for Kukirin so you aren't gonna get any OTA updates.

I got a Kukirin G2 Max. The display died before even 1000km. The company sent me a new one but not before doing some tests, like reseating the connections. But the worst part was they made me open up the scooter which meant ripping up some of that rubber mat and then they wanted me to check the voltage on the battery and charger. I'm half handy so I was willing to do this, but WTF? You want a customer to check voltage with a multimeter? When I checked the charger it gave me a HUGE spark. Naw fk that.

I enjoy the scooter but, the design decisions are weird. I bought new shocks so I disassembled the front. And to my surprise the bolt and the nut on the front axle don't use the same size socket! In a sense it meant that I could use a socket wrench on both sides when tightening/loosening the nut but its just weird. It made it feel like its put together with whatever parts they could find. Not sure if other scooters are like that?

Why? Well, for this price range, you won't get 2-piston hydraulic brakes with ebas, 12-inch off-road tires, and a very wide deck. I can go 70 to 75 km an hour if I'm on turbo duel motor. I never go this speed, but just so you know, I'm still testing range and suspension, but so far, it's great. Very smooth transition from a smooth road to off-road, and the way it climbs hills is just super easy. 2400 watt duel motor.

You're going to see good reviews and bad ones for all of them unless you're getting into the few-thousand-dollar range. Your options and quality range open up so much more. You should look into it, plus you can add a seat if you want to. I hope you get the scooter you're looking for. Also, make sure your tire PSI is 35 to 40 if you go with this one.

reddit,2025-10-13T17:39:56,Murky-Smoke,"Welding aluminum is far more complicated than steel or other metals.

Even IF you found a welder with the skills to do it, AND he took the time to do it properly by heat treating the entire frame afterwards, which would require dismantling the scooter and removing internal components like steering bearings, fasteners and the stem bolt completely... It is not cost effective because you'll likely pay the welder more than the scooter is worth, even if you dismantle the scooter yourself to save on labour.

More importantly... The strength/structural integrity of the entire aluminum body is downgraded and no longer safe to ride. The degree of that downgrade depends on the skill of the welder but it is unavoidable.

The next time it snaps, it will be more catastrophic than the aftermath you see here.

In short, re-welding aluminum is a no-no and can cause the entire thing to shatter when it fails next, and it WILL fail without any tell tale signs or warning next time.

If you really want to keep the scooter It's often more economical and safe to replace the frame and move all your existing components into it, or just buy a new/upgraded one entirely.",https://reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/1o5kk5o/hello_relectricscooters_i_am_a_proud_owner_of_a/njb3kds/,2,negative,-0.8433,Pricing,Affordability,Price perception

reddit,2025-10-13T15:10:04,FedulRasta,"On the one hand, I am against the law, which will oblige all scooter drivers to get a license. On the other hand, looking at what is happening on the streets, I come to the conclusion that it is necessary to oblige all scooter drivers, even if not to get a motorcycle license, but at least to take driving training courses for several months.

Last fall, I got a job at a rental scooter repair service. We had several workshops and many tables for repairs. That is, we took broken scooters and piles, repaired them, then went out to check if everything was in order, and then handed them over to the test department. All movements around the workshop took place on scooters, constant trips between tables, people, boxes. One of the rooms was a meter lower than the entire building and there was a metal sheet there so as not to carry the scooter on your hands.

In the spring, I bought my first personal scooter. And then I realized that those few months in the workshop had become a good driving school. In fact, all winter, 5 days a week, for 12 hours, I maneuvered in narrow aisles so as not to hit people, walls or tables.

And on the streets, I see children as young as 14 riding a Kukirin G2 Pro Max, and I understand that they do not have much experience driving a scooter, but even a car or motorcycle, which gives at least some understanding of how to behave on the road. I've seen many cases of people who are over 40 years old riding a scooter, as if they don't even believe they can fall. Or vice versa, they stand like pillars, shackled, such trips usually end in falls.

In my city, at least once a week during the summer, a child crashed into a car on a rental or personal scooter.

Of course, I think (few people will support) that the more fools there are on scooters, the fewer fools there will be on scooters in the end, since they won't live long. But damn it, they're crashing into pedestrians.

Not freak out pedestrians, the more you freak them out the more likely they are to make some noise about regulation and then fun times are over B. Cars are not expecting a pedestrian to zip by the sidewalk at high speeds so when they're driving on autopilot there's a typical walking speed that they're expecting or know that they can react to when they pull out on to the sidewalk to make a turn.  The higher your speed is relative to walking speed the higher the chances of this type of collision happening.

I live in San Jose, where we're building buffered bike lanes everywhere; when I see scooter riders eschew those huge bike lanes for the sidewalk I wonder why they have a death wish. It then occurs to me all they know is sidewalks from walking, and assume scootering is the same, which it very much isn't.

And naturally, because I'm not keen on slamming into a car coming out of an intersection, I don't just go full throttle across any street crossing. I slow, check the intersections and cars that could be coming up behind me, stop if there's anything resembling someone turning across where I'm going, and then be on my merry way.

And even then, the moment a Pedestrian is coming up, you slow, get off the scooter if it's too tight for you to squeeze by riding, and wave to signal you're not going to be a dingus. 

The closest thing I've been in on a scooter in a city was with a kick scooter, going about 8-10 MPH equivalent at the fastest. So while I understand blind corners there, this really sounds like all parties involved weren't checking their corners.

If it’s a split wheel just make sure all the air is out of the tire.  Then remove the six bolts holding the wheel together.  Remove the tube or tire if it’s tubeless .  Tubeless use six zip ties around and thru the tire:  then simply replace the tire with a new one.  If it’s tubeless you can use a plug purchase in auto store the easiest way to do it.  If the hole is too big then replace the tire with one from Amazon.  Use zip tie method to replace.  Before you proceed with replacing the tire watch a few videos on YouTube before you attempt replacement.  Good idea to seek out videos before you even consider replacing the tire or tube.

Peep the technique instead of the tools. Criss cross the levers against the axle and pull in opposite directions. It should pop right off on that side. For reinstall, find something (I used a pot) to keep the tire flush with the rim. That helps prevent it from moving around while you get the tire over the lip. It doesn’t have to be exactly what the lady has, or even two people.

I try to buy ones that come with a proprietary seat as they usually attach in a more secure manner, however I recently purchased one that came with one of these universal seats as the factory supplied seat. When installed correctly it's just as secure as most other seats. I can pick up the scooter by the seat alone, shake it and put it down with absolutely no play. I would suggest swapping the actual saddle on this though as others have said, try to get one with suspension springs - I recommend searching ""cruiser bike seat"" as that style usually has springs and a nice wide seat.

Mainly because whenever people try and stay under $1000, you’re basically eliminating the possibility of hydraulic brakes or other small comforts that can make a scooter easier to maintain and repair over the long-term. But if your budget is very firm something similar to kukirin g3 pro. Essentially something between 20 and 30 mph with maybe 20 or 25 miles of range depending on your weight. This is something that would be a realistic upgrade in terms of speed and range without breaking your budget. Although I will contend that if you’re spending a little bit more, you’d be able to get something that I think would prevent the need for future upgrades and be something that will last a bit more long-term. 
This is all assuming you’re in the US because availability and pricing of course is going to be vastly different if you’re in Europe or outside of the USA. 
These scooters usually do have a lock needed to turn on the display, but nothing that locks into place or locks up the motor. You should keep in mind that that locking feature is generally on cheaper mass market scooters. But it is sufficient to prevent anyone from turning it on or messing with it if you have it locked up someplace public.

I definitely relate to what you are saying, although I still crashed within the first 6-8 weeks but it was due to death wobbles which I didn't really understand/know about that well as I wasn't really going that high of speeds regularly. I didn't know some escooter models you need a dampener even for going in the 20-30s/mph range because poor design I guess.

If you really want something to fill the skating itch but more fun, check out the 2swift. It's literally an escooter deck but no stem essentially, so it's very differently designed than other eskateboards. It feels a lot like snow or longboarding.

To me escooter feels more like windsurfing, because when you windsurf you keep your arms up the whole time holding on the sail, the only difference is where your arms are - in escooting it's obviously directly in front while windsurfing it's to the side, but the way you navigate and balance.. it feels so much like it.

reddit,2025-10-13T02:15:26,HighKage96,"There are three main reasons for that: a bent disc, a misaligned caliper or faulty pistons.

Most likely it’s a misaligned caliper or a bent disc. Check the disc from the side while rotating the wheel to see if there’s any visible damage. Also, try aligning the caliper properly, you can even get a silly tool for that to make the job quicker.

But I wouldn’t trust those Kaabo-Zoom hydraulics they’re pretty mid. I’ve gone through five pairs in two years and I’m planning to upgrade to Hope. I do ride off-road and push the limits though, but Zoom's-Kaabo’s stock brakes are well known for not being the most reliable at mid-long term.

Not acusing you of anything but didnt you check the brakes before the ride previous to the accident? Cause every time i felt theyre not gonna work is cause pre ride i already noticed they were not working good so i take cautions when i know theyre not fully operational.

The only time they didnt work when i needed is when the hose exploded on me but that was my fault cause i mounted the hose passing through couple pieces it should not pass and pinched it.
And i do put them through a lot drifting, offroading etc so i just partially blame them brakes, then also knew few competitive riders who still use zoom calipers in spanish escooters competition so idk.

On my Nami, EVERY 3rd party part that uses a 2 pin connector has reversed leads, and when it comes to 3 pin connectors, sometimes one of the +- leads need to relocate to the 3rd pin, reversing just the +- leads isn't enough.

This means that unless I am willing to move those wires to the correct pin placement on the connector, most simply will not work.

In short. All the electrical components on a Nami are -ev, while virtually all 3rd party components are wired for +ev.

Thankfully, because it's a popular brand, I get much easier ways to make them compatible... Many shops custom build and wire upgrades for Nami scooters, OR there is a conversion cable available which you can insert between the new component and the wiring harness which flips the polarity, making any 3rd party component compatible.

If it's wet, I lightly towel it down, but I don't try and get all the dirt off while it's still mucky.

Once it's dry, I'll use an air gun or my little car vacuum on the reverse setting to blast as much crud as I can away, and wipe it down with a damp cloth.

Or, if it's still really dirty after air blasting it, mix a small bowl with a drop of my car wash soap and hot water. I use my stiff nylon bristle brush for cleaning my car rims to gently scrub the scooter, wipe it off with a damp cloth (no need to rinse), then use a toothbrush with the same soapy water to get in any nasty nooks where crud has built up.

I like cleaning because it gives me a chance to inspect the entire scooter up close and look for any issues or defects that need to be addressed. I double check any bolts I think may be loose and ensure my dampers are still clamped properly and my folding mechanism is tightened.

Obviously try not to really use water. I am aware there are some no-water cleaners out there that you can buy, but I haven’t bought them. I have only used soapy water when I wanted to really get my fenders nice and clean even though they’re gonna get dirty again in the next ride, maybe a little bit when I also clean my cockpit up a little bit. 

Maybe I will consider some of those cleaners, though.

Kindly advise on the pro pack validity and charges afterwards. Please?",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIbrynqcwQ8,0,negative,-0.2824,User Experience,Ride & Comfort,General mention

This comes at a time when rista with its superior ather software is giving a competition in the market. Mind you that unlike ola and ather which have an e sim and can show live maps,Iqube has no such feature and needs to be connected to bluetooth only to give basic turn directions and not a view of the map.

youtube,2025-03-01T21:46:46Z,@globalentertainment3169,"I bought the Ritza in January 2025, and now I regret my decision.  

**Issues:**  
- The seat hinge is very weak and does not justify the scooter's cost.  
- The suspension is extremely stiff, making rides uncomfortable, especially on bad roads.  
- When riding uphill, the speed naturally decreases, but it does not recover even on flat terrain. The scooter remains slow until it is restarted.  
- The software has several lags. In Smart Echo mode, the speed sometimes exceeds 60 km/h, while at other times, it struggles to go beyond 30 km/h.  
- In Zip mode, the scooter occasionally fails to cross 40 km/h.  
- The dashboard does not display an accurate speed reading. The speed sometimes drops or increases suddenly without any real change in the scooter’s movement.  
- The key knob feels like a cheap toy—flimsy and overly loose.  
- The joystick is not very responsive; you have to press multiple times to open the menu.  
- Bluetooth does not stay off. Even after turning it off, it automatically turns on every time the scooter is restarted.  
- The seat does not close properly and remains loose. While riding, it makes a constant rattling (""gud gud"") noise on the road.

The front suspension on the Rizta is seriously underwhelming. It struggles to handle even the smallest bumps and cracks on the road. Every time I hit a pothole or uneven patch, the suspension doesn’t absorb the impact well, causing the handlebars to vibrate like crazy. It’s not just annoying—it’s uncomfortable, especially on longer rides.

If you’re considering the Ather Rizta, keep in mind that the suspension might not live up to your expectations, especially if you’re riding on roads that aren’t perfectly smooth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f99UwfL20Ps,4,positive,0.3147,User Experience,Ride & Comfort,General mention

Rizta S variant with pro pack (without WhatsApp, fb calls notification, you can't store documents and without map navigation) with 8 years warranty on battery. 
they said that we will replace battery if its capacity goes below 70% but they will check it according their own norms which we don't know. 
The price is 138k. On-road Delhi. 
After applying all the discount offers. 

Jupiter 110 was 115k. including all accessories. 

By just paying 23k more, I still get an anxiety of 100 km range and 8 hours of charging time. And with every passing year, this range will decrease, and the charging time will increase. 
Not all have a safe space to charge their two-wheeler peacefully. 
No storage after putting the charger and helmet. 
The new battery cost is 70-80k. 

I run roughly 4k km per year, go to local service once a year, costs me around 700-800 rs. Time 1 hour. 
 50km/litre is the average mileage. 94 Rs/litre petrol price. 7520 rs of petrol per year. 
after 15 years = 113k rs.

And recently my skid control had stopped working after the January software update. I had to wait for the February update for it to fix that issue.
So software side there are some refinements that are still needed.
Using the heck out of the magic twist and coasting regen to get excellent range.
I ride to my office, a distance of 22kms and I get more than 40Km/ unit of battery efficiency most of the times because of the regen.

Solution  -  ride starting 1000km with coasting regen on ,after 1000 km it will give great acceleration up to 70km/hr top speed 
With s eco mode you don't need to switch modes to overtake, also give more range than zip and with coasting regen braking it helps the drum brakes which is weak

I had minor issue like charge symbol was showing whle put on charge then in few mintues the rizta automatically rebooted and it was fine, the dashboard got hanged twice on 60-70 speed, but it does not affect ride and automatically rebooted in after 10 minutes and was back to normal 

charging at home is simple as I leave it on charge and take off when going to office, it has auto cutt off so no issues. Initially you will feel the suspension is stiff, as you along, you will get used to smooth rides wont be bothered about suspension and it will not be affected.

I used to have around Rs 3000 exp for my commute, now I dont know how much I spend on charging, as I charge on my apartment plug point, need to check on it.

I would suggest to get the Rizta Z 2.9, it's the best of all worlds.
But also... very very importantly... be honest with your usecase.

I have 3 riding members, me, my sister and my father.
my previous scooter was Activa 4g, reliable, cheap and shitty with mileage.
we hardly go above 40 in the city, and when we need power, we have the zip mode.
our daily mileage is hardly 40 -50 kms.
the buttons, functionality and everything else is damn simple for my father to use.
It's spacious for my mom and my sister for shopping and comfort.
it just works.

They drop it? It's all plastic body, get it replaced. Ather gets you the original parts easily.
Overally, you will spend least, than on petrol each month.
But beware there's the initial lumpsum cost involved for getting the Rizta, and unsure after pro-pack.

Pros :- super handling, fun to ride
Cons:- 
1.The seat is not so comfortable
2. The service quality is not even average its poor.
3. The service cost is soo expensive that I even paid 10k for 2 times.. for example during my 49k kms riding the belts that are used in ather worn out very quickly and i changed 3 times each costed me around 3500rs.. general service charge is 850, a very small electrical connector which costs 50rs in local electrical shop costed me around 800rs including labour charge..
4. The service time they are taking is too long.. they sold many scooters and they r having very few employees to do the service... That's the reason they are taking too much time, poor service quality...
5. Charging infrastructure is not well established and the price for fast charging is 1rs per min + gst...for example the fast charger only charges upto 80%.. the charge the scooter from 10-80% it will take somewhere around 80-90mins... So it's 90rs + gst= ~110rs... And with that 80% charge  u will get only 70-75kms..
6. The battery is degrading very quickly.. out my 50k kms i only fast charged my bike 10-15 times only and in the first 1½ years the range dropped from 90kms to 65kms per full charge and under Warranty they said they repaired the battery.. now the range I'm getting is little better.
7. Service interval:- for every 5k kms we have to do the service.. and some times it will cost u 1200 and sometimes upto 10k.
8. The spare parts are way to costly. The front brake pads are 604+ gst + labour charges... each belt costs around 3-3.5k, where a normal activa belt costs around 1000 and it will last long up to 50k kms..

Conclusion:- im in confusion that Im maintaining an EV or a super bike. I think I made the wrong investment by putting my money on EV. I just want to go back to ICE😢",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrNSgmxT3Jw,1,negative,-0.8752,Product,Battery & Charging,Fast charging praised

1. Sometimes when I am parking the vehicle in reverse mode , the software glitches and turns off the reverse mode automatically. This happens within the span of 1 second. I almost ended up getting into the road and driving perpendicular to the traffic. 

2. There are times when the display freezes randomly. It can happen anytime and anywhere. The problem that occurs to me is I cannot change the driving modes at that time. And I am unaware of the display freeze so when I try to overtake any vehicle I shift from eco to zip mode but because I am still in eco mode I end up going parallel to the vehicle and into the incoming traffic. 

Everything else is fine but these 2 issues are a huge huge safety hazard. I contact ather and informed them multiple times , I have also had them repeatedly service it but the problem still exists. The service team from ather have been giving their best effort to fix it. I have also spoken with other rizta owners. They don't seem to noitce anything like this yet.

youtube,2025-01-05T05:10:59Z,@Kise_ryouta7,I've owned a Rizta Z 2.9 for about 3 months now and I absolutely love this machine. The driving experience is so sophisticated which makes the ICE Scooters feel archaic. Most of the features that you're getting are useful and will make your life a bit easier in the city; some of them are pure gimmicks and you'll figure it out pretty soon. Smart Eco feels pretty dull sometimes even for the city roads as Shumi mentioned but that's the mode you'll have to be in to extract the best range. Zip mode is seriously fun but takes a toll on your range...anywhere from 12-15 kms. Ride comfort & suspension is good enough for it's intended city use & yes you'll feel the bumps on bad roads. Overall I'm really happy with the purchase and Ather's service has been amazing at addressing small niggles I've had till now.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrNSgmxT3Jw,46,positive,0.9902,Product,Battery & Charging,Range mention

To me personally, the 450 was the choice for a fun scooter and the iQube was the practical no-brainer. Funny thing is both Ather and TVS have had good reputation of making reliable electric scooter, there could be one-off case where there could have been an issue. But they have largely remained niggle free. My main concern was when you said 'it struggled to climb some incline'. What mode was this on? I am asking cuz you were talking about Smart-Eco mode just before that. Its funny how electric scooters have high torque and from get-go and still struggle in these scenarios, a fossil fueled scooter even with less torque wouldn't face the issue.
May be you should do a compare (again?)  between petrol vs electric scooter in everyday scenarios, you know two adults plus one kid (or two in many scenarios). I know it can legally only carry two, but reality is far from that no?
