This comes at a time when rista with its superior ather software is giving a competition in the market. Mind you that unlike ola and ather which have an e sim and can show live maps,Iqube has no such feature and needs to be connected to bluetooth only to give basic turn directions and not a view of the map.

**Issues:**  
- The seat hinge is very weak and does not justify the scooter's cost.  
- The suspension is extremely stiff, making rides uncomfortable, especially on bad roads.  
- When riding uphill, the speed naturally decreases, but it does not recover even on flat terrain. The scooter remains slow until it is restarted.  
- The software has several lags. In Smart Echo mode, the speed sometimes exceeds 60 km/h, while at other times, it struggles to go beyond 30 km/h.  
- In Zip mode, the scooter occasionally fails to cross 40 km/h.  
- The dashboard does not display an accurate speed reading. The speed sometimes drops or increases suddenly without any real change in the scooter‚Äôs movement.  
- The key knob feels like a cheap toy‚Äîflimsy and overly loose.  
- The joystick is not very responsive; you have to press multiple times to open the menu.  
- Bluetooth does not stay off. Even after turning it off, it automatically turns on every time the scooter is restarted.  
- The seat does not close properly and remains loose. While riding, it makes a constant rattling (""gud gud"") noise on the road.

The front suspension on the Rizta is seriously underwhelming. It struggles to handle even the smallest bumps and cracks on the road. Every time I hit a pothole or uneven patch, the suspension doesn‚Äôt absorb the impact well, causing the handlebars to vibrate like crazy. It‚Äôs not just annoying‚Äîit‚Äôs uncomfortable, especially on longer rides.

If you‚Äôre considering the Ather Rizta, keep in mind that the suspension might not live up to your expectations, especially if you‚Äôre riding on roads that aren‚Äôt perfectly smooth.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f99UwfL20Ps,4,positive,Other,Other,,2,1,1

Rizta S variant with pro pack (without WhatsApp, fb calls notification, you can't store documents and without map navigation) with 8 years warranty on battery. 
they said that we will replace battery if its capacity goes below 70% but they will check it according their own norms which we don't know. 
The price is 138k. On-road Delhi. 
After applying all the discount offers. 

Jupiter 110 was 115k. including all accessories. 

By just paying 23k more, I still get an anxiety of 100 km range and 8 hours of charging time. And with every passing year, this range will decrease, and the charging time will increase. 
Not all have a safe space to charge their two-wheeler peacefully. 
No storage after putting the charger and helmet. 
The new battery cost is 70-80k. 

I run roughly 4k km per year, go to local service once a year, costs me around 700-800 rs. Time 1 hour. 
 50km/litre is the average mileage. 94 Rs/litre petrol price. 7520 rs of petrol per year. 
after 15 years = 113k rs.

Enjoying the experience so far, but there are a few complaints which are all on the software side only. So basically as you mentioned the Hill Hold is glitchy. It did not work for me most of the times.
And recently my skid control had stopped working after the January software update. I had to wait for the February update for it to fix that issue.
So software side there are some refinements that are still needed.
Using the heck out of the magic twist and coasting regen to get excellent range.
I ride to my office, a distance of 22kms and I get more than 40Km/ unit of battery efficiency most of the times because of the regen. Meaning my riding style can easily extract a range of nearly 140kms in a single charge, which is pretty impressive and I ride in the Zip mode 100% of the time.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrNSgmxT3Jw,1,neutral,Product,Battery & Range,battery,1,1,0

Solution  -  ride starting 1000km with coasting regen on ,after 1000 km it will give great acceleration up to 70km/hr top speed 
With s eco mode you don't need to switch modes to overtake, also give more range than zip and with coasting regen braking it helps the drum brakes which is weak

I had minor issue like charge symbol was showing whle put on charge then in few mintues the rizta automatically rebooted and it was fine, the dashboard got hanged twice on 60-70 speed, but it does not affect ride and automatically rebooted in after 10 minutes and was back to normal 

charging at home is simple as I leave it on charge and take off when going to office, it has auto cutt off so no issues. Initially you will feel the suspension is stiff, as you along, you will get used to smooth rides wont be bothered about suspension and it will not be affected.

I would suggest to get the Rizta Z 2.9, it's the best of all worlds.
But also... very very importantly... be honest with your usecase.

I have 3 riding members, me, my sister and my father.
my previous scooter was Activa 4g, reliable, cheap and shitty with mileage.
we hardly go above 40 in the city, and when we need power, we have the zip mode.
our daily mileage is hardly 40 -50 kms.
the buttons, functionality and everything else is damn simple for my father to use.
It's spacious for my mom and my sister for shopping and comfort.
it just works.

They drop it? It's all plastic body, get it replaced. Ather gets you the original parts easily.
Overally, you will spend least, than on petrol each month.
But beware there's the initial lumpsum cost involved for getting the Rizta, and unsure after pro-pack.

Pros :- super handling, fun to ride
Cons:- 
1.The seat is not so comfortable
2. The service quality is not even average its poor.
3. The service cost is soo expensive that I even paid 10k for 2 times.. for example during my 49k kms riding the belts that are used in ather worn out very quickly and i changed 3 times each costed me around 3500rs.. general service charge is 850, a very small electrical connector which costs 50rs in local electrical shop costed me around 800rs including labour charge..
4. The service time they are taking is too long.. they sold many scooters and they r having very few employees to do the service... That's the reason they are taking too much time, poor service quality...
5. Charging infrastructure is not well established and the price for fast charging is 1rs per min + gst...for example the fast charger only charges upto 80%.. the charge the scooter from 10-80% it will take somewhere around 80-90mins... So it's 90rs + gst= ~110rs... And with that 80% charge  u will get only 70-75kms..
6. The battery is degrading very quickly.. out my 50k kms i only fast charged my bike 10-15 times only and in the first 1¬Ω years the range dropped from 90kms to 65kms per full charge and under Warranty they said they repaired the battery.. now the range I'm getting is little better.
7. Service interval:- for every 5k kms we have to do the service.. and some times it will cost u 1200 and sometimes upto 10k.
8. The spare parts are way to costly. The front brake pads are 604+ gst + labour charges... each belt costs around 3-3.5k, where a normal activa belt costs around 1000 and it will last long up to 50k kms..

Conclusion:- im in confusion that Im maintaining an EV or a super bike. I think I made the wrong investment by putting my money on EV. I just want to go back to ICEüò¢",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrNSgmxT3Jw,1,neutral,Product,Battery & Range,battery,2,2,0

1. Sometimes when I am parking the vehicle in reverse mode , the software glitches and turns off the reverse mode automatically. This happens within the span of 1 second. I almost ended up getting into the road and driving perpendicular to the traffic. 

2. There are times when the display freezes randomly. It can happen anytime and anywhere. The problem that occurs to me is I cannot change the driving modes at that time. And I am unaware of the display freeze so when I try to overtake any vehicle I shift from eco to zip mode but because I am still in eco mode I end up going parallel to the vehicle and into the incoming traffic. 

Everything else is fine but these 2 issues are a huge huge safety hazard. I contact ather and informed them multiple times , I have also had them repeatedly service it but the problem still exists. The service team from ather have been giving their best effort to fix it. I have also spoken with other rizta owners. They don't seem to noitce anything like this yet.

The driving experience is so sophisticated which makes the ICE Scooters feel archaic. Most of the features that you're getting are useful and will make your life a bit easier in the city; some of them are pure gimmicks and you'll figure it out pretty soon. Smart Eco feels pretty dull sometimes even for the city roads as Shumi mentioned but that's the mode you'll have to be in to extract the best range. Zip mode is seriously fun but takes a toll on your range...anywhere from 12-15 kms. Ride comfort & suspension is good enough for it's intended city use & yes you'll feel the bumps on bad roads.

youtube,2024-06-18T05:38:50Z,@acntforyt9803,"MISLEADING Don't buy Rizta:
Ather Paywalls safety and fundamental functionality in pro pack:

Safety features that are ""optional and paid"": 
SkidControl TM 
AutoHoldTM
Auto Indicator Cut-off
Emergency Stop Signal
FallSafeTM
Find My Scooter
Tow & Theft Notifications

Fundamental ""optional & paid features"":
SmartEcoTM Mode
Dashboard - Auto Brightness
Real-time Charge Status

This is such a anti-consumer business strategy, especially for ""Family scooter"", you don't make safety features optional and paid in family bike. And if you do then better everyone should only talk about scooter price with propack included always. Rizta without propack is tier 3 chinese whitelabled entry level scooter at best, even if I buy 1.45L ex-showroom worth of top variant I have to shell 20k more on the safety and fundamental features. 
Now 1.72L for a family scooter? No wonder why Activa & Jupiters are still selling, no wonder why my F77 suddenly doesn't sound that expensive comparatively, for ammount of bike I'm getting.

As for Mr. Presenter, your rate of speech has been more controlled in this particular video, which I thought is better. But you need to work on your last bit in your sentences that you say, they just slip out. Have control on your entire sentence so that we listeners can understand what you dish out.

youtube,2024-05-24T06:48:49Z,@TheLazyWandererMys,"I am more interested in knowing how this stacks up against the iQube. To me personally, the 450 was the choice for a fun scooter and the iQube was the practical no-brainer. Funny thing is both Ather and TVS have had good reputation of making reliable electric scooter, there could be one-off case where there could have been an issue. But they have largely remained niggle free. My main concern was when you said 'it struggled to climb some incline'. What mode was this on? I am asking cuz you were talking about Smart-Eco mode just before that. Its funny how electric scooters have high torque and from get-go and still struggle in these scenarios, a fossil fueled scooter even with less torque wouldn't face the issue.
May be you should do a compare (again?)  between petrol vs electric scooter in everyday scenarios, you know two adults plus one kid (or two in many scenarios). I know it can legally only carry two, but reality is far from that no?
