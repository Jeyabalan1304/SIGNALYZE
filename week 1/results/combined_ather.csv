reddit,2025-10-11T09:31:09,1PerpetuallyAnxious,"Take test drives for 450x and Rizta, both. I don't know where you're based, but I assume your city also has pothole filled roads, make sure to test drive on the worst roads for a good 15-20 mins. This will give you an idea of comfort. Rizta might give you better comfort for a 30 km ride in heavy traffic, but this is purely up to your personal preference.

I have to do 4 trips of 10 km each everyday through little to no traffic and went with Ather 450x 3.9kW. The fuel expense was burning a hole in my pocket and it was heartbreaking to see my 3rd most largest expense after rent and food was fuel.

I've barely spent 40 Rs. in charging cost and already travelled 250+ km on the Ather. Check out your local EV charging points whether Ather grid or other plug and pay outlets. Get an idea if they're working, being maintained, and if you have plenty of options around. Same for your college locality. Always plan ahead as a worst case scenario backup. If you feel you're covered on the charging points front, you can explore the EV option.

I absolutely love the ride on the Ather and have no regrets over this model. It's so light that my sister and my SO both enjoy it and say it's easy to handle. My sister is now planning to get the same model for herself.

reddit,2025-10-08T16:07:46,iam_man_ish,"Here’s the inside scoop that many don't know, based on what happens during actual claims. You're right to be skeptical about specific ""EV covers"" for two-wheelers. The main issue is salvage value.

Think about it, just like you said: if the battery on an Ather is severely damaged, what's the real value left in the rest of the scooter? Almost nothing.

Because of this, if there's major damage to the battery or motor, the repair cost can easily be more than 75% of the scooter's value. When that happens, the insurance company will declare it a ""total loss"".

This is exactly where the Return to Invoice (RTI) add-on becomes the real hero.

If your scooter is declared a total loss (which is very likely after major battery damage), the RTI add-on ensures you get back the full original on-road price you paid. Not just the current market value (IDV).

So, a much safer strategy for a new scooter isn't hunting for a specific battery cover, but making sure you have a solid Return to Invoice (RTI) add-on. It's the cleanest and most effective way to protect your investment.",https://reddit.com/r/ATHERENERGY/comments/1o1coei/getting_the_right_insurance_for_your_ather_a/nifyh7j/,4,,,,

reddit,2025-10-09T15:54:41,iam_man_ish,"Thats a major point of confusion for many EV owners after these Battery warranty from the Brand.

The simplest way to think about it is: **Insurance is for ACCIDENTS. Warranty is for PERFORMANCE & DEFECTS.**

Let me break it down based on your question:

1. **Your Insurance (Return to Invoice and Battery Protect):** This covers your scooter from sudden, unforeseen events. The Battery Protect add-on would help if your battery gets damaged in a **crash, a flood, or a fire**. If the damage is so severe that the scooter is a ""total loss,"" the RTI add-on would get you the full invoice value back. It will **not** cover the battery if its health just drops over time from normal usage.
2. **Ather's Warranty (the 'eight seventy' plan):** This is the manufacturer's promise about the product's quality and performance. If your battery health drops below 70% from normal charging and use within the warranty period, **this is a warranty issue**. Ather is responsible for replacing it, not the insurance company.

So, to answer your question directly: No, insurance will absolutely not cover the battery replacement if its health drops below 70%. You would still need the Ather warranty for that kind of performance-related issue.

You need both, as they protect you from completely different kinds of problems. It's like having health insurance to cover a broken leg (an accident) vs. the manufacturer's warranty on your phone if its screen stops working on its own (a defect).

I was asked to wait for about 30-60 minutes and to check with the salesperson, which I appreciated. Luckily, it was resolved within 40 minutes. I was then advised to pick up the vehicle in the evening. While the process was a bit slow initially, I appreciate the staff’s efforts to resolve everything once I followed up.

Look, The Rizta is an amazing EV, hands down. The first time i experienced Zip mode, it blew me away. Even today when the signal turns green, it zips ahead in an instant.

Talking about Service, it obviously depends on your location, however in my experience it has been so far amazing. The Staff is friendly and very welcoming.

Now, coming to the point of 8 Years Battery warranty. You need to understand that the stock price gets you 3 years. You have to upgrade to the pro pack to get it upto 5 years and then you unlock the 8 year tier. You cannot go to the 8 year mark without getting the pro pack. So cost is going to be a consideration. Especially if you compare to traditional ICE scooters, the 8 year tier is going to set you back by a good amount.

I personally own 3 Athers, 2 of which have the 8 year warranty. It is a no brainer if you value comfort and top notch features that wont let you down.

When i brought my rizta sometime back, i had a fixed idea. I needed Magic Twist and Skid control. I almost never need Navigation and fancy display, but the Z is the only option if you need Magic Twist and Skid Control, so i got the Z.

If you feel that you can do without maps and the ""Z"" feature set, then go for the S with 159 IDC.

And dont drive the scooter with only cost savings in mind. Many people emphasize so much on range and cost mathematics that they simply dont enjoy the upgrade that their ride got. Yes, it is cheaper. But more importantly, it is a lot better quality wise.

As for the points he has missed:
- Service people might be friendly, but their technical knowledge can be very poor depending on the centre and area.
- It caused a limp mode issue in the first week of ownership to me, never again (lots of people have this experience).
- In the rain, it is highly reliable but would suggest you to immediately swap those MRF tyres, their grip is completely absurd. CEAT is my family choice and from recent posts, Michelin is great. If you stick to MRF, the road grip confidence drops a ton with pillion or on less grippy roads.
- Ather battery and motor are great but everything except that has gone through a lot of quality downgrades. The plastic can be easily damaged and if you ride in bumpy roads...oh well.
- The biggest natural enemy is rats..they got my wires twice.
- Other is coneset issue, even after repair it doesn't go away (one 20k Km user reported it has been a recurring for him as well)
- The main point is charging. If you have even a single inconvenience for charging system setup, please avoid the EV sector. Many apartment or flat users get EV and then are always fighting for bills and permissions. Leaving your system in the open has been a pain as well.

reddit,2025-10-04T05:36:09,anonymous-_-maybe,"I have experienced both and the more reliable one is the eco mode. It has less range but it is precise and the speed and throttle is fixed. So when you want to overtake and you know you can manage it at that limited speed , you have control of the situation. 
The smart eco has more range ( 10 -15 kms ) but its throttle and top speed are variables. They depend on certain conditions which you don't know exactly. Initially you will get a good boost and after a few kms of driving the throttle is slowly reduced to save range. The problem lies in the fact that the throttle is so slow that to get from 20 to 40 kmph speed it takes 15 seconds. Enough to cause trouble. On a good day the smart eco will totally behave like zip mode and I won't even notice the throttle drop anywhere in my 34 km journey and on random days the throttle will nearly get me into an accident . It is unreliable in my opinion.

Second is network. Ather uses a lot, I mean a lot of battery just to stay connected to network. It can drain 10% overnight if you live in a very poor network area. It's normally 2-3% otherwise.

Last would be weight on scooter, your driving habits and tyre pressure.

Now coming to Ather fault:
- MRF tyres lose a lot of air pressure due to its structure, get them changed if necessary
- New Atherstack has made several scooters range drop by 10-20%
- Sometimes front brakes keep pressing, an old issue which still creeps in making range lower. You have get those repaired.

But ather sales team themselves keep suggesting not to use ather grid saying ""It will hurt your battery"". Does getting fuel at the station hurt your scooter? If it does, it's more of a dealer problem not a scooter problem. E20 is good for E20 compatible vehicles. Yamaha Fascino is famous for giving 65kmpl+  due to its hybrid engine (Father owns a Fascino and lots of Honda in past). There's a reason almost more than half of Goans own Fascino. Jupiter also gives 50kmpl+, only honda is lacking at 40kmpl owing recent lack of innovation in favour of reliability.

Chetak, iQube, Ola and Ather, all these big 4 EVs are failing in my region. If you ask them their issues after a year of use, half of them are either unaware that they are experiencing any issues thinking its normal for EVs. The other half has gotten good EVs. But still among these people if you were to point out any common issue you will find that they all have the same experience.

In my area, there are 3 service centres. The 2 major SC gets 40+ scooters per day for repairs and many of them are repeat. Like why would you want to be a repeat SC visitor?",https://reddit.com/r/ATHERENERGY/comments/1nvwb7x/planning_to_book_ather_450_apex_this_festive/nhd6de3/,2,,,,

This comes at a time when rista with its superior ather software is giving a competition in the market. Mind you that unlike ola and ather which have an e sim and can show live maps,Iqube has no such feature and needs to be connected to bluetooth only to give basic turn directions and not a view of the map.

**Issues:**  
- The seat hinge is very weak and does not justify the scooter's cost.  
- The suspension is extremely stiff, making rides uncomfortable, especially on bad roads.  
- When riding uphill, the speed naturally decreases, but it does not recover even on flat terrain. The scooter remains slow until it is restarted.  
- The software has several lags. In Smart Echo mode, the speed sometimes exceeds 60 km/h, while at other times, it struggles to go beyond 30 km/h.  
- In Zip mode, the scooter occasionally fails to cross 40 km/h.  
- The dashboard does not display an accurate speed reading. The speed sometimes drops or increases suddenly without any real change in the scooter’s movement.  
- The key knob feels like a cheap toy—flimsy and overly loose.  
- The joystick is not very responsive; you have to press multiple times to open the menu.  
- Bluetooth does not stay off. Even after turning it off, it automatically turns on every time the scooter is restarted.  
- The seat does not close properly and remains loose. While riding, it makes a constant rattling (""gud gud"") noise on the road.

The front suspension on the Rizta is seriously underwhelming. It struggles to handle even the smallest bumps and cracks on the road. Every time I hit a pothole or uneven patch, the suspension doesn’t absorb the impact well, causing the handlebars to vibrate like crazy. It’s not just annoying—it’s uncomfortable, especially on longer rides.

Rizta S variant with pro pack (without WhatsApp, fb calls notification, you can't store documents and without map navigation) with 8 years warranty on battery. 
they said that we will replace battery if its capacity goes below 70% but they will check it according their own norms which we don't know. 
The price is 138k. On-road Delhi. 
After applying all the discount offers. 

Jupiter 110 was 115k. including all accessories. 

By just paying 23k more, I still get an anxiety of 100 km range and 8 hours of charging time. And with every passing year, this range will decrease, and the charging time will increase. 
Not all have a safe space to charge their two-wheeler peacefully. 
No storage after putting the charger and helmet. 
The new battery cost is 70-80k. 

I run roughly 4k km per year, go to local service once a year, costs me around 700-800 rs. Time 1 hour. 
 50km/litre is the average mileage. 94 Rs/litre petrol price. 7520 rs of petrol per year. 
after 15 years = 113k rs.

And recently my skid control had stopped working after the January software update. I had to wait for the February update for it to fix that issue.
So software side there are some refinements that are still needed.
Using the heck out of the magic twist and coasting regen to get excellent range.
I ride to my office, a distance of 22kms and I get more than 40Km/ unit of battery efficiency most of the times because of the regen.

youtube,2025-01-06T03:11:18Z,@dannyanderson2147,"I own ather rizta 3.7kw using it for more than 2m, I travel to office daily, I am in night shift so only travel on zip mode with speed of 60-70, and 70-80, as I take highway in morning to escape traffice, so with 105 range on zip mode, I consume 35% charge on city at night and on highway due to long distance 40-45% charge, and that usually leave me with 30-25% charge for total of  50-55 km. I had minor issue like charge symbol was showing whle put on charge then in few mintues the rizta automatically rebooted and it was fine, the dashboard got hanged twice on 60-70 speed, but it does not affect ride and automatically rebooted in after 10 minutes and was back to normal 

charging at home is simple as I leave it on charge and take off when going to office, it has auto cutt off so no issues. Initially you will feel the suspension is stiff, as you along, you will get used to smooth rides wont be bothered about suspension and it will not be affected.

I used to have around Rs 3000 exp for my commute, now I dont know how much I spend on charging, as I charge on my apartment plug point, need to check on it. Saving cost on perol and going to petrol bunk is a big relief",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrNSgmxT3Jw,2,,,,

I would suggest to get the Rizta Z 2.9, it's the best of all worlds.
But also... very very importantly... be honest with your usecase.

I have 3 riding members, me, my sister and my father.
my previous scooter was Activa 4g, reliable, cheap and shitty with mileage.
we hardly go above 40 in the city, and when we need power, we have the zip mode.
our daily mileage is hardly 40 -50 kms.
the buttons, functionality and everything else is damn simple for my father to use.
It's spacious for my mom and my sister for shopping and comfort.
it just works.

They drop it? It's all plastic body, get it replaced. Ather gets you the original parts easily.
Overally, you will spend least, than on petrol each month.
But beware there's the initial lumpsum cost involved for getting the Rizta, and unsure after pro-pack.

Also, I got the extended battery warranty for 80000 kms / 8 years, it just makes sense.",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrNSgmxT3Jw,1,,,,

youtube,2025-01-05T14:54:03Z,@charanreddy2504,"I have been using the 450x gen 3 for the last 2 years and with that experience I'm writing this comment...
Pros :- super handling, fun to ride
Cons:- 
1.The seat is not so comfortable
2. The service quality is not even average its poor.
3. The service cost is soo expensive that I even paid 10k for 2 times.. for example during my 49k kms riding the belts that are used in ather worn out very quickly and i changed 3 times each costed me around 3500rs.. general service charge is 850, a very small electrical connector which costs 50rs in local electrical shop costed me around 800rs including labour charge..
4. The service time they are taking is too long.. they sold many scooters and they r having very few employees to do the service... That's the reason they are taking too much time, poor service quality...
5. Charging infrastructure is not well established and the price for fast charging is 1rs per min + gst...for example the fast charger only charges upto 80%.. the charge the scooter from 10-80% it will take somewhere around 80-90mins... So it's 90rs + gst= ~110rs... And with that 80% charge  u will get only 70-75kms..
6. The battery is degrading very quickly.. out my 50k kms i only fast charged my bike 10-15 times only and in the first 1½ years the range dropped from 90kms to 65kms per full charge and under Warranty they said they repaired the battery.. now the range I'm getting is little better.
7. Service interval:- for every 5k kms we have to do the service.. and some times it will cost u 1200 and sometimes upto 10k.
8. The spare parts are way to costly. The front brake pads are 604+ gst + labour charges... each belt costs around 3-3.5k, where a normal activa belt costs around 1000 and it will last long up to 50k kms..

Conclusion:- im in confusion that Im maintaining an EV or a super bike. I think I made the wrong investment by putting my money on EV. I just want to go back to ICE😢",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrNSgmxT3Jw,1,,,,

youtube,2025-01-05T10:37:07Z,@Rupu1996,"I have been using the rizta top end model for almost 4k kms now. There are 2 serious issues I have had so far. 
1. Sometimes when I am parking the vehicle in reverse mode , the software glitches and turns off the reverse mode automatically. This happens within the span of 1 second. I almost ended up getting into the road and driving perpendicular to the traffic. 

2. There are times when the display freezes randomly. It can happen anytime and anywhere. The problem that occurs to me is I cannot change the driving modes at that time. And I am unaware of the display freeze so when I try to overtake any vehicle I shift from eco to zip mode but because I am still in eco mode I end up going parallel to the vehicle and into the incoming traffic. 

Everything else is fine but these 2 issues are a huge huge safety hazard. I contact ather and informed them multiple times , I have also had them repeatedly service it but the problem still exists. The service team from ather have been giving their best effort to fix it. I have also spoken with other rizta owners. They don't seem to noitce anything like this yet.

They live in tier 3 city, so with 100km range, they have to charge the scooter only once in 10 days. This was the first time we got EV, so they were a bit skeptical.

youtube,2025-01-05T05:10:59Z,@Kise_ryouta7,I've owned a Rizta Z 2.9 for about 3 months now and I absolutely love this machine. The driving experience is so sophisticated which makes the ICE Scooters feel archaic. Most of the features that you're getting are useful and will make your life a bit easier in the city; some of them are pure gimmicks and you'll figure it out pretty soon. Smart Eco feels pretty dull sometimes even for the city roads as Shumi mentioned but that's the mode you'll have to be in to extract the best range. Zip mode is seriously fun but takes a toll on your range...anywhere from 12-15 kms. Ride comfort & suspension is good enough for it's intended city use & yes you'll feel the bumps on bad roads. Overall I'm really happy with the purchase and Ather's service has been amazing at addressing small niggles I've had till now.,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NrNSgmxT3Jw,46,,,,

Tow & Theft Notifications

Fundamental ""optional & paid features"":

To me personally, the 450 was the choice for a fun scooter and the iQube was the practical no-brainer. Funny thing is both Ather and TVS have had good reputation of making reliable electric scooter, there could be one-off case where there could have been an issue. But they have largely remained niggle free. My main concern was when you said 'it struggled to climb some incline'. What mode was this on? I am asking cuz you were talking about Smart-Eco mode just before that. Its funny how electric scooters have high torque and from get-go and still struggle in these scenarios, a fossil fueled scooter even with less torque wouldn't face the issue.
May be you should do a compare (again?)  between petrol vs electric scooter in everyday scenarios, you know two adults plus one kid (or two in many scenarios). I know it can legally only carry two, but reality is far from that no?
