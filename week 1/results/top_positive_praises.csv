I've owned a Rizta Z 2.9 for about 3 months now and I absolutely love this machine. The driving experience is so sophisticated which makes the ICE Scooters feel archaic. Most of the features that you're getting are useful and will make your life a bit easier in the city; some of them are pure gimmicks and you'll figure it out pretty soon. Smart Eco feels pretty dull sometimes even for the city roads as Shumi mentioned but that's the mode you'll have to be in to extract the best range. Zip mode is seriously fun but takes a toll on your range...anywhere from 12-15 kms. Ride comfort & suspension is good enough for it's intended city use & yes you'll feel the bumps on bad roads. Overall I'm really happy with the purchase and Ather's service has been amazing at addressing small niggles I've had till now.,2
I have ather rizta 3.7kwh. i love riding experience. Everything is good except ignition lock. Dashboard lag is occasional. i hate smart eco.,2

Shorter sentences and deeper breaths before takes will help you not run out of breath before completing one sentence",1
"Thanks for ur inputs......I recently bought the Ather Rizta Z and found that the brakes were not responsive as compared to the Activa is used to own. The Reverse button also feels very flimsy as the quality can be improved. Yes, I bought the wall mount for the fast charger and they charged me about Rs.2700/- if I recollect it right...yes just about that. I also bout the Rizta bodygaurd for Rs.3500/- which is needed on indian roadsüòÑüòÅ",1
"I own this vehicle. Breaks are amazing. 
Few days back I was driving at 65kmph, a guy came in middle of the road. Literally these breaks saved me from the accident. If I was driving any other scooty I am pretty sure it would be worse. I feel very confident riding rizta. Don‚Äôt blindly believe these reviews. Go the showroom , do a test and then decide it by yourself.",1
"So I took this rizta for a test ride and in under 2 seconds I found that seat height is good but the handle bars are so low that its riding triangle is the worst ever. I had so much strain in my shoulders that I immediately stopped the test ride and yes no youtuber will tell you that period.

That bleak looking 450x was so much better than this rizta. So skip this scooter for sure and buy 450x.",1
