Yes. And no. Your pad 50' from the house is about the same level of difficulty as those with an electrical panel in a basement and their garage on the other end of the house. And while not totally rare, not all that common country wide.

I grew up with a father who built houses as a GC second job. And have always been interested in how homes are done around the country as I traveled and lived in multiple states. Where I grew up, what you describe is rare. But I can see if as somewhat more often in other areas. And there are places like row houses in Baltimore and similar where issues arise getting power from your panel to where you park.

Each case can be different. I'll agree. But step one for anyone who might think of an EV is drop the concept of filling up at a gas station as a base line. It may not work for you. But it does work for a lot of people.

Smart Eco is literally making you use more regen by cutting off excessive torque and if u want the torque back the only way is to let it regen by not using brakes.


What i do when i drive in smart eco is i keep the power band very low like 10-20% throttle max & use regen all the time.
So the power stays on for a very long time although the acceleration is pretty slow but it will have instant torque when needed!

I would suggest everyone to use sports or warp mode 100% of the time and use less throttle, it will give you same or more range than smart eco + you have enough power whenever needed just incase of emergency.",https://reddit.com/r/ATHERENERGY/comments/1nwtsj7/smarteco_colour_change_while_driving/nhjgdbq/,2,positive,0.7465,Product,Battery & Charging,Range mention,neutral

reddit,2025-10-13T20:08:28,markeydarkey2,">. I would assume that the wheel well is bigger with two axles in the rear, so you'd be *losing* volume from the inside.

The wheelwells are longer but not as tall, if you're trying to maximize passenger room you want lower (& narrower) wheelwells because the rearmost seats are typically packaged over/at the rear wheelwells. This is the reason why minivans all look the way they do, they use small wheels with bodies hanging low to convert as much of their footprint into interior room as possible. If you have two sets of even smaller wheels you can boost that effect further. Lower wheelwells can give a lower load floor too, semi-trucks use a bunch of trailer wheels instead of huge tractor wheels for the same reasons.

>Maybe they are thinking that the extra axle provides more support for a larger -- that is, heavier -- cabin?

By distributing the weight over 4 tires instead of 2 they can use smaller tires for the same weight load.

Imagine you're trying to load the largest object possible into a room with immovable boxes in the corners, it would probably be easier if [the boxes were smaller](https://i.imgur.com/38tk870.png) and [lower like this](https://i.imgur.com/iVweswB.png).",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o5ry4d/lexus_seriously_wants_to_replace_ls_with_this_bev/njbxw78/,2,positive,0.8552,Service,After-sales,Service experience,neutral

Quote:




Can we expect a preemptive strike against the fascist West by the mighty Global South ?


.




Lets hope, that doesn't go so far and the West doesn't become fascist. 




These days, the Global South appears to be in an advantageous position vs. the West:




The Global South could now shut down Western economies just by denying access to resources and markets. 




As we know, the West can not have manufacturing and services (the secondary and tertiary sectors of the economy) without the supply of resources from the Global South.




The reality today is, the West faces a number of challenges, among the biggest is managing a transition from a financialized economy to a more balanced economy with a strong manufacturing sector.




The sad story is, Westerners are no longer independent actors, for example, if they want to achieve this transition, the goodwill of the Global South is a prerequisite. But why would the Global South be willing to help the West, let alone a fascist West ?




If the West can't manage this transition the economic, social and political consequences will be severe. As, with the progress of the agendas of the BRICS+ group, the West is threatened with loss of huge income from its gigantic financial sector, linked to reserve statuses of Western currencies and Western control of the global financial system.




Really, the West is finding itself in a very difficult situation. 




As the West declines, the self-confidence in the Global South is growing and growing. In the meantime, the Global South countries have become so powerful, that they can decide, if Western efforts to rebuild their manufacturing sector will succeed or not, just by supplying or not supplying resources and opening or not opening their gigantic markets.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o3xkn2/china_imposes_export_controls_on_lithiumbatteries/nj902mz/,1,negative,-0.8461,Service,After-sales,Service experience,negative

reddit,2025-10-13T14:21:21,Immediate-Report-883,"I had a BEV as a work vehicle for 2.5 yrs, but when it came to return it and I needed a new personal vehicle I went PHEV instead. 

Every day during my commute I wish i went BEV, but now on a road trip, I am glad I went  PHEV. 

And that's the problem.  I live in an area that has high BEV adoption, but also dense housing. So public chargers are always full. You have to have access to at least lvl 1, and for many in apartments, that's not possible. Energy costs are high here, so workplace chargers are popular, non-existent or stupid pricey (saw a Lvl2 charger asking for almost 0.60$ a KW). Reliably and conveniently being able to charge overnight is the first hurdle. Figure  that out, and you can handle the day-day to usage. 

The second problem lies in geography. The US is big and the road trip is ubiquitous. A 300mi range (on the low end) is no big deal in an ICE when the process of refueling it takes minutes and you have to work to find an area without gas in any 50mi radius. That means even the most secluded of locations are viable. That very quickly breaks down for a BEV. This becomes even more of an issue for those that are towing. 

Which brings me to a rant with Tesla. They took money from the other major OEM to open the network for non-Tesla vehicles with adapters or even native NACS ports, but they still. Keep about 30% of their network exclusive, and it's not limited to locations such as their properties. A non-Tesla can't charge at any Tesla SC in Flagstaff for example. Or at all in states such as South Dakota. Small towns outside of National Parks are also frequently off limits, even though they have Gen 3+ chargers. 

So the answer to that one yearly trip where the BEV is difficult, one solution would be to rent a vehicle. Go look at rental fees, Turo host behavior and Hertz AI scanners. A 2500mi road trip might cost you 625$ in lease overage miles, but that's less than a week worth of time in a rental, and that assumes no bullshit fee afterwards. 

So solve the day to day charge issue. Then make the road trip work. Then you'll see widespread BEV adoption. But without either of those, you simply won't.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o2zgue/what_of_us_consumers_are_good_candidates_for_bevs/nj9ytah/,1,negative,-0.9507,Product,Battery & Charging,Fast charging praised,negative

Even IF you found a welder with the skills to do it, AND he took the time to do it properly by heat treating the entire frame afterwards, which would require dismantling the scooter and removing internal components like steering bearings, fasteners and the stem bolt completely... It is not cost effective because you'll likely pay the welder more than the scooter is worth, even if you dismantle the scooter yourself to save on labour.

More importantly... The strength/structural integrity of the entire aluminum body is downgraded and no longer safe to ride. The degree of that downgrade depends on the skill of the welder but it is unavoidable.

The next time it snaps, it will be more catastrophic than the aftermath you see here.

In short, re-welding aluminum is a no-no and can cause the entire thing to shatter when it fails next, and it WILL fail without any tell tale signs or warning next time.

If you really want to keep the scooter It's often more economical and safe to replace the frame and move all your existing components into it, or just buy a new/upgraded one entirely.",https://reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/1o5kk5o/hello_relectricscooters_i_am_a_proud_owner_of_a/njb3kds/,2,negative,-0.8433,Pricing,Affordability,Price perception,negative

Wan had been a big fan of EVs and tested Tesla’s first EV model, the Roadster, in 2008, the year it was released. People now credit Wan with making the national decision to go all-in on electric vehicles.
