A major design flaw is the placement of the rear wheel and the batteries. 
The rear wheel tends to shower the battery enclosure and motor with mud. It then hardens and makes a sort of insulation over the batteries and doesn't allow cooling.

reddit,2025-05-01T08:15:13,FreeBirdy00,"It's all about incentives and motivation. Moreover it's about purpose. These things might seem superficial in the first go but this is precisely the reason IITMIC is incubating startups while billion dollar firms in India aren't.

IITMIC being an institution and getting funded by GOI has no reason to be particularly greedy about profits and climbing up the ""financial ladder"". Their sole goal is to kickstart and push the technological ecosystem forward in the country. Also a sidenote but I think this mindset is particularly present only at IITM and not other IITs (I would assume because of leadership and vision that IITM has). But yeah this is a big reason.

While TCS, Infosys etc are more focused on driving profits and that too in the most ancient and non-visionary way i.e. by selling labor to other bigger firms. They have no particular interest in nation-building or innovating and they don't have any motivation for making the next big thing that normally leading companies do which gives them edge over everybody. Therefore they don't incubate or try to contribute to developing an ecosystem.

Unfortunately we don't have visionaries and original thinkers like Paul Graham who can make a YC in India to push the startup ecosystem ahead. But we do have a lot of talent. I think the closest thing to a YC in India being done at a large scale is coming from Sridhar Vembu. He seems to be the only guy calling out and confronting the problems in Indian tech ecosystem and also accepting the abundance of talent and working towards channelizing it through his rural area plans.

reddit,2025-08-09T13:44:22,P3t3rPanC0mpl3x,"My mum dated a military man before I was born. He would get drunk and depressed and utter 'In 50 years something will happen. You'll know it when it does. You'll need to go to \*\*\*\*'. Mum used to repeat this to me a lot and tell me the location.   
  
Mum died 15 years ago. I started to see everything shape like she said it would. She didn't realise my love of history and the cosmos meant I could see pattern where she could not.   
  
I focused on the Reader's Digest article in the early 80s that an object in the far solar system had been found. I was hoping you were going to post that. It seems to have been scrubbed since 2013ish along with other things on the internet that were easily obtainable and have seemed to have disappeared.   
  
With my 15 years of research and having been given a life long heads up on this situation, I have to admit to something else, It used to horrify me but I see as an advantage now (I guess..): I download. I've suffered other things that seem to run along side the download phenomena but the only reason I know I download is because I have had people witness it once. I've turned into a bit of a loner otherwise, I would say I would get caught out more. There's a few interactions that line up with 'the phenomena' but beings and behaviours don't line up with anything else I've seen reported.  
  
I only say this because while I promised my mum I wouldn't give the location to get to, away, it is moot because I'm urged to ask you not to go to them. I know with the location I was told that I will be there but above ground. If I survive, I will bury the bunker dwellers in. You're likely becoming more and more aware of the locations in your own country.  
  
I'm told it is exactly what happened at Gobekli Tepe. The elites constructed a society that ensured only their salvation. They manipulated their citizenry or stole from them to create underground palaces while they left their unwittingly enslaved to burn or drown. The survivors realised, the bunker dwellers never resurfaced. They buried them in. The meek inherited the Earth. The same must happen. No universe deserves the vibration of a people like that. Consciousness is important.  
  
From everything I've researched or been made aware of, I'm sure it is cyclical. Why else would the man Mum dated know to say 'In 50 years...'.   
  
Read Plato's account of Solon's conversation with the Egyptian clergy. Their description fits impact events, both water and land. A description for each. We've known since ancient Egypt. We didn't forget. It has been gatekept.

I suspect there will be a period of time where the object is visible to the naked eye before 'the crossing'. I suspect they will do as much as possible to prevent us from noticing: wars and games. I don't think it is as bad as they will be attempting to distract us, yet but you can feel them raising their game no end the past few years. Which reminds me, I should probably say that Mum wasn't supposed to be able to have any more children. She was a model and popular...her urgent marriage to my dad was a result of her pregnancy. I was born in 1977. 48 years ago.",https://reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/1ml2zq5/3iatlas_2027_prediction_dp2147_planet_x_niburu/n7rxfsw/,19

Conclusion:

The astronomers best positioned, geographically and technologically, to detect and confirm DP-2147 were systematically removed, ensuring that no credible, authoritative detection entered the official astronomical record before its 2027 approach.

By eliminating the small circle of experts who could have caught it early in IR or specialized optical windows, any independent confirmation was bottlenecked to state-controlled surveys, allowing the object’s existence, orbit, and nature to remain deniable until it’s too close for public suppression.

Analysis of geographic visibility, instrument capability, and death timelines indicates that every astronomer with both the positional advantage and the specialized equipment to detect DP-2147 in its pre-perihelion window is now deceased, several under abrupt or suspicious circumstances. The removal of this specific cohort effectively collapsed independent verification channels, leaving only large, state-aligned survey programs with the capacity to observe the object. This outcome ensured that any hard data on DP-2147’s existence, trajectory, and physical characteristics could be controlled, delayed, or denied outright until its 2027 approach, preserving strategic secrecy over an asset or threat of extraordinary significance.",https://reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/1ml2zq5/3iatlas_2027_prediction_dp2147_planet_x_niburu/n7ztt1d/,6

From what I understand they have the ability to disappear from one point in space time and appear in another.

Travel for them is not just faster then light but is faster then thought coherence.

They don’t need week or months or years to travel from one star to another. Travel for them is instantaneous.

For them it wouldn’t even feel like moving , it would feel like they stayed in one place and the universe moved around them because that is the level of physics they have mastered.

So to me if they were coming to reset the planet they wouldn’t need to give us a heads up by letting us track them and giving us an ETA.

It would be game, set, match…

There wouldn’t be a thought between your eyes , it would just be over and they could probably end it with an instant rather than cause global catastrophes.

The Earth does this itself anyway when it shifts polar regions every few thousand years so it would be redundant.

If anything I think when this has happened they have saved certain parts of the populations the ones they thought could start again after the cataclysms.

If you look at the ancient Indian texts they said they watched a great flood from space on the Vimanas.

The aztecs had a similar story about being taken away by sky beings and brought back after an Earth catastrophe aswell as the Dogone tribe in Africa and some Native American tribes.

If they can distort space time and trigger and catastrophe would it not just be easier to cause correct humanity instead of starting a 2Billion year cycle again? Even if time is inconsequential to them.

There are many here who understand consciousness is a singularity and operate in Christ Consciousness, so to end this world and hope the next species does better would be abit over the zealous.

Its probably just to make first contact with the civilian population, if certain deep black military and funded corporations have know for a long time and kept extra terrestrial life a secret, against the will of the other civilisations around us.

Perhaps it’s a way of telling them to spill the beans because we are coming…

That makes more sense to as to why people like Lou Elizondo and Chris Melon and Dr Gary Nolan etc have been constantly going on about catastrophic disclosure.

As if they know something is coming and they will walk amongst us and make themselves known.

Joe Rogan asked SahdGuru about ET life and he said he had seen them in the Kilash Mountains so he couldn’t deny the existence.

But he said until they are ready to introduce themselves to humanity…carry on with your life.

reddit,2025-08-08T23:27:23,None,"GPT5 calls bs

This Reddit post is a long speculative narrative tying together several unrelated topics—space probes, the “Pioneer Anomaly,” obscure historical astronomical sightings, orbital mechanics, conspiracy theories about hidden observations, and even alleged alien involvement—into the claim that an object designated “DP-2147” will make a close approach to Earth in January 2027.



Here’s a breakdown of the key claims versus known science:



1. The Pioneer Anomaly



Real phenomenon: Both Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft showed a small, unexpected deceleration toward the Sun.
Known explanation: By 2012, peer-reviewed studies concluded this was due to anisotropic heat radiation from the spacecraft’s power systems—essentially, heat acting like a tiny thruster.
The post dismisses this explanation as “going against thermodynamics,” but in fact it is entirely consistent with thermodynamics and well-modeled.




2. DP-2147 / DP-4721



There is no official or peer-reviewed record of astronomical objects with these designations in known minor planet or comet catalogs.
The alleged 1827 and 1859 “sightings” align more with historical misidentifications of planets or stars (the “Planet Vulcan” hypothesis, later disproven).
The orbital diagrams and parameters in the post are constructed without citation to actual astronomical datasets.




3. 6.55-year orbital period and 25,000-year cycle



These numbers seem reverse-engineered to fit speculative links between unrelated solar cycles, geological events, and pseudoscientific catastrophism (e.g., Younger Dryas, Atlantis).
No known celestial body of the described mass and orbit exists; if it did, it would cause major perturbations in planetary orbits and would already be easily detectable by modern telescopes.




4. Alleged observation suppression



Claims about deaths of astronomers, shutdowns of observatories, or intentional concealment of telescope capabilities are unsubstantiated conspiracy narratives.
The “Sunspot Observatory” 2018 closure had a mundane explanation (law enforcement investigation unrelated to astronomy), not suppression of a sighting.




5. Alien involvement and remote viewing



The last sections pivot to unverifiable accounts from remote viewing sessions, “greys,” and other UFO lore—none of which are considered scientific evidence.




Bottom line:

This entire piece is a highly imaginative blend of real historical science, outdated hypotheses, misinterpreted data, and conspiracy speculation. There is no credible astronomical evidence for a massive, stealth, near-Earth object with the described parameters approaching in 2027. If an object of even a fraction of the claimed size/mass were on such a trajectory, it would already be tracked by multiple space agencies and amateur astronomers worldwide",https://reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/1ml2zq5/3iatlas_2027_prediction_dp2147_planet_x_niburu/n7ousev/,6

reddit,2025-08-09T10:19:20,sopharella,"This is pseudo scientific gibberish mixed with new age buzzwords. The atlas object follows a  hyperbolic trajectory through our solar system with a velocity well in excess of the sun‘s escape velocity. That makes it per definition not possible for it to follow any orbit around the sun, no matter how eccentric this orbit may be. This has nothing to do with the hypothetical Planet X and lacks any evidence. If this thing had the mass of a planet it would change the planetary trajectories of the whole solar system.

The rest of your post has literally nothing to do with this and is just new age BS. You are using physics buzzwords to make unverifiable and flat out wrong claims without any apparent knowledge about the theories. 

Your Paradoxon falls apart when you look at how the universe, life and the planet evolved. Obviously there has to be matter first for physical observers to exist and observers in quantum physics have nothing to do with consciousness.

To quote Werner Heisenberg:
„Of course the introduction of the observer must not be misunderstood to imply that some kind of subjective features are to be brought into the description of nature. The observer has, rather, only the function of registering decisions, i.e., processes in space and time, and it does not matter whether the observer is an apparatus or a human being, but the registration, i.e., the transition from the ""possible"" to the ""actual,"" is absolutely necessary here and cannot be omitted from the interpretation of quantum theory.“

reddit,2025-08-10T14:34:49,NukeTheNerd,"They lost me at the radioisotope thermoelectric generators explanation for the Pioneer Anomoly violating thermodynamics. The explanation is actually a well understood effect in spacecraft engineering. Because the thermal radiation was escaping in an  asymmetrical pattern (conducted through the structure of the spacecraft), the conservation laws were preserved. Not to mention the idea that they just back engineered the model to fit the data sort of falls apart when you consider that the model made predictions consistent with the data, like how the force from the escaping thermal radiation would change over time as the generators aged and their power output declined. There were subtleties in the data that this model explained. That strengthens the argument considerably.

And, speaking of subtleties, this seems to suggest that both spacecraft experienced the exact same deceleration. Patently false. The given deceleration was the result of averaging. There were variations between the spacecraft. But, since they were practically identical and used the same generators, the deceleration was extremely similar between them. As for it happening in the same region of space, that's misleading. These spacecraft were launched about a year apart. This deceleration only became detectible when they were far enough away from the sun that other forces acting on them became negligible. They both reached that point separately. So, of course, you could only detect the anomaly once they crossed that threshold. It's not like they entered a magic region of space and the deceleration just started. You could only detect it after a certain point. If you're whispering and the TV is blaring, I can't hear you. Once I turn the TV down, I can now hear you. Pretty basic. 

As for them not having the same exact orientation, temperature or power output, that wound up resulting in some of the strongest evidence for the thermal recoil model there is. It's far from a knock against it. Why? Because these differences were reflected in the data. The deceleration these craft experienced with these differences at play were consistent with the model. Acting like it's a sign that the explanation is bogus is disingenuous at best. It's a sign that it's correct. 

How am I supposed to take any of this seriously if there are this many issues with the opening paragraphs? I read the first slide and immediately had to make this comment. I'm sure that, when I read the rest, there will be more glaring issues. I still plan on looking at it, though...

Edit: Ok, yeah... This isn't science. To begin with, Dp. 2147 was cataloged five times in the journal they linked to over a two year period, not just twice over three nights like they claimed. And the observational data suggests that it was almost certainly just a variable star. Based on the magnitude observations and its consistency over those five observations, that's a totally reasonable conclusion to draw. Nothing about the data in that journal suggested it was moving in a way that would've precluded it from being a star. In fact, it suggested that its behavior was totally consistent with a star. And, I mean, really... Whoever wrote this struggled to even consistently write down the observation's catalog number. They have it as 2141 and 4721 in different places. That should tell you the level of detail that went into this. Hilariously, this does exactly what they accused the folks who solved the Pioneer Anomaly of doing... They started with a conclusion and tried to make some data fit it.

reddit,2025-08-08T19:39:13,Icy-Contribution1525,"I asked chatgpt to summarize for us:

  
The post explores a theory that **aliens are not visitors, but ancient wardens of Earth**, guiding human evolution and consciousness. These beings subtly influence humanity's spiritual and intellectual growth, helping us awaken to the **true nature of existence**—that **consciousness is the essence of God** and the foundation of reality.

The author believes Earth is an **incubation chamber for sentient life**, and that a **mysterious device (possibly the Moon)** manipulates Earth's core and climate to reset civilization when it goes astray. Humanity is at a tipping point due to misuse of technology, pollution, and spiritual immaturity.

The post emphasizes that **everything is one**—race, religion, and individuality are illusions. True progress requires **unity and self-realization**. Reality itself is created through **conscious observation**, and death is just a transition to another energetic form.

Ultimately, it suggests that we live in a **paradoxical universe** where the **observer (consciousness)** is what enables existence, and we must evolve to reconnect with the **source**—God as universal consciousness.",https://reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/1ml2zq5/3iatlas_2027_prediction_dp2147_planet_x_niburu/n7nnqbd/,84

reddit,2025-08-10T05:56:56,AdTraditional5146,"Thank you for the anecdote, it makes sense. The military guy was privy to it. I do not know of the news article saying they found something in the outer area of the solar system. 

Eisnhower treaty expried within this decade of the 2020's. They had 70 years to develop a contingent plan. Bunker creation didnt start until after the treaty was signed in '52 i believe. 

They did a good job keeping it under wraps until the 1970's military dude, forgot his name, talked about it. Then the man who was an expert in finding areas to demolition for bunker making talked about it and the next year was silenced in the form of suicide. He was not suicidal and his family was very suspicious of his death with all his important records he kept stolen.

Everything i have learned points towards this event now, it is all coming to a head and all evidence leads to the end of our cyclical era. The nordics, i believe are the ones in control of this device. We are theyre lab experiment/genetic offspring manipulated from primates or who knows really. 

Jason jorjani, on the Danny Jones Podcast has an interesting theory on data collection and information theory that ties into thermal dynamics.

Basically, the nordics destroyed their homeworld because data centers became gravitational. In a processto reverse it they nuked their own planet to tty to eliminate the data centers. They had a few moments, couldnt say if it was days, years, or thousands of years.

They made the moon to the specific dimensions that we all are fascinated over, hollowed it or built it hollow as a metal structure. Which has gravity generators. Hence why the moons mass is disproportionate to the amount of gravity it exerts, slowing the earths rotation and allowing for terraforming of earth, as it spun faster, had a different atmosohere makeup causing mega fauna to exist. 

it is also theorized by J.J. that they directed the asteroid into the planet to destroy the dinosaurs. Also, carbon dating can be flawed. Anything that had high energy burts of radiation cause carbon dating to be warped by atleast hundreds to thousands of years. Idk whst the impact of an asteroid would do for that.

If that thing is a station with a large amount of gravity its safe to assume the nordics learned how to harness dark matter and use it to disrupt the core of the planet to dislodge tectonic plates and cause floods. 

Im sure they would all band together to figure out a solution if the planet was about to be ended. Thsy also seem to be intune with their ability to use the brain for psycic powers. Greys have the ability and because of walton abduction, i would say the greys are made from the nordics and given the ability to do what they do and put humans into stasis.

There is also a super wild theory i have about it all, but it is prolly my mind enveloped too much with this stuff. If this is a simulation they are attempting to summon the wardens of the reality we inhabit inorder to figure out how to escape the dream world we live in. 

So, if this thing is a rock, thank god. If it is an alien space station that has come to reset us, god bless each one of your souls and i pray for each humans salvation to the realm of pure conciousness. I believe regardless, we are on the brink of something epicly proportionate in retrospect to an archon(christ of jesus) returning to the material realm to finally bring about rapture. 

I can feel it. Ive been increasingly privy to info from all over the place that leads to the one outcome. A cleansing of the planet and reduction in the damage we have caused to the environment and the human genome with PFAS, carbon polymers, weaponized viruses, nuclear fission, and others. The owners of the planet are dissapointed with the weakness caused by greed and utter disstain for human life and nature. 

It should have been a few thousand years into the future that we shoukd have delt with this, but its gone to far with our advancements in science and no real advancements in the ability to understand another persons feelings, thoughts, and intentions. All working as one, for one goal. The betterment and enlightenment of the way of reality.

Many live in reality and are slaved to malicious thinking and malevont intent. Few live in accordance with love and understanding. The hammer has been struck and the decision is final. If we cannot all come together and overthrow the evil at the head of our kingdoms, what is there but death for all and a new beginning to try again?

I wish you all a safe passage into the aether. May you meld back with the one and become blissful in your peace. I hope its the biggest psyop in history, it would be the longest running one too.

Satellites we sent out have been directly affected by something with it's own gravitational field they directly slow once they get to a specific zone.
Earth sized (artificial) Object comes in cycles that have negatively affected earth purposely or not. Most scientist who've researched the object have died. Solar observatories have been targeted to not cause panic the object is hard to see for the first 4 planets(us included) by regular means.
They speculate young dryas and other cataclysms were the result of the artificial object ""scanning"" coming close and dislodging asteroids due to its orbit and earths gravitational pull. 


Vulcan was the name of the assumed planet that came in and out of our solar system.

reddit,2025-08-10T15:19:13,AAAStarTrader,"Sorry old chap, but Physics says no such thing. 

Our conciousness and it's relationship to our physical body does not dictate the physical reality we live in. We do have a spirit/soul which can leave or enter our bodies/minds, but that doesn't make our very complex living, breathing biological bodies any less real or physical.

Moreover,  we can very much trust our senses, despite popular internet misinformation or researchers conceptualising our sensory processes in such a way as to cause confusion with the general public. Please use critical thinking and common sense. 

The laws of physics are mathematical approximations to describe the universe around us, and model or reality. Mathematics is not reality itself. Physics formulae, do not dictate the hard, real, touchable, seeable, smellable, hearable, tasteable, real solid objects all around us. We have several senses which can together corroborate the existence of matter based objects using multiple sensory inputs (living or inanimate). 

As an example, if I leave my apartment, I know it will be in exactly the same location on my return, with the same furniture content in exactly the same positions as before. This alllows me to have a professional cleaning service come to the apartment and clean and vacuum, knowing they will see everything I see in exactly the same positions and sizes, and the contents will not have dissappeared in my absence. They can even take a photo and send it to prove it's the same! Unless the camera is also hallucinating?? Lol 😅

Which is another easy way to disprove this ridiculous notion that we can't trust our eyesight,  and not trust solid physical objects we are certain are real and in a particular location are really real?? Really??? Your camera will corroborate exactly what you see. The camera will corroborate that another human sees exactly what you see, and that all the contents of my apartment DOES EXIST  when I am not present, and is identical for anyone else entering that same apartment, even after I die! You can corroborate your perception with other humans in the same room,  who will be able corroborate exactly what you see,  down to the smallest details, positions,  colours, textures, etc. 

Meaning? Meaning, that *of course every solid object we see is actually there*, and *very real* and we can indeed very much trust our very exceptional and accurate senses. Try drawing on your arm with a Sharpie if you don't believe your senses. Certainly has an ink effect like a real pen!

To be clear, we DO NOT send our so called ""visual hallucinations"" over the ether to another human being just to be manifested in real time in order that the contents, including my coffee table!, look identical for the cleaning staff??? That is the type of process whixh would be necessary as an actual implication of ""manifesting"" reality. (Which is obviously nonsense.)

Mathematical models (Laws) simply help us model things we wish to calculate or estimate or build or measure or forecast etc, to an acceptable level of accuracy for practical purposes.

Quantum Mechanics is poorly understood and not very well modelled, since we cannot yet describe the means and the mechanism for 2 entangled particles to simultaneously decohere at vast distances apart. There is no underlying law/equation for that process yet. Therefore there is a lot still to learn and cherry picking the wave function (which is a statistical probability), doesn't help describe solid objects that in certain versions of QM, are made of collapsed particles (although there is no physical collapse, it's a modelling description from Quantum Maths). Particles which have lost their probabilistic wave nature and settled into particle mode, to group together with other particles at the point these atoms are brought together to manufacture an object or piece of furniture! Such as, stainless steel, those atoms when brought together in the smelting process should have all ""collapsed"" and when the metal cools and hardens, the object (kitchen knife) has no uncertainty, just a mass of combined particles in a regular solid structure such as the blade. We perceive the photons bouncing of this hard surface of a kitchen knife blade, to take care not to cut ourselves, and position the blade accurately with our conbined motor perception, touch perception and visual perception. It is a real, solid object made in a factory, and transferred to our possession. No one at any point manifested the finished object, with it's combined wooden handle, some holding rivets, all machined and finished in a manufacturing facility. NOT in our minds! 😁

Human senses are very accurate. We can see if an object or a picture hanging on the wall is out of alignment by only 1mm, just by casually looking at it!  This is repeated across 8bn humans,   minus people with eye conditions or injuries. The average adult human has more or less the same accuracy. 

We have motor perception which corroborates the 3D position of objects, and we can move our hand, or foot, to that exact point in 3D space with reflexive speed and accuracy. When I drop something in the kitchen, I'll reflexively catch the item without even looking and my senses guide my motor response to catch things before they hit the floor e.g. fork, tomato, etc. Our senses therefore MUST represent the solid real world, otherwise that skill wouldn't be possible, and we wouldn't perceive solid objects accurately enough to intercept them in 3D space. 

VISION: The tolerances in visual accuity between healthy human eyes in different individuals is highly synchronised, allowing everyone to navigate in 3D space, walk in busy shopping mall without ever bumping into anyone or anything, because on average we all share the same accurate 3D position accuracy which allows us to move through moving crowds with accuracy. If we all had individual estimates of distance and position that were not commonly accurate within an average tolerance then people would constantly bump into others, hit stationary objects, never successfully play a game of football,  etc.  Evidence of how we see real things/people/animals/plants in the real world that are common to everyone in the same location, disproving that we are all hallucinating what we see, otherwise we would be bumping people, walking in front of vehicles, misjudging where the door actually is. And constantly bumping into that coffee table, because we can't tell where exactly it is or is it there at all???...Ouch!!!...fxxk, fxxk, fxxk!!!! Yes, definitely there! 😆

In addition,  our colour perception is better than any digital camera yet produced. So is our light exposure compensation (Tesla if your reading? That's why only cameras with today's technology  can never be as good as a human driver! LIDAR!! Just sayin') . Thus if a human selects a standardised colour from the Pantone range, then another individual can look at that and identify which exact colour it matches to in the colour catalogue, without prior knowledge. They both share a common perception of that colour, unless they have colour blindness. Our important senses are all calibrated within fairly tight tolerances, except with health conditions etc. 

Anyway, hope this all makes good common sense. Reality, fluid, solid matter, inanimate objects, living beings, plants, gas are all real. Solid objects are permanent,  unless some physical process disrupts them.  Solid objects can be here before you are born, and there after you die, like Mount Everest for example. 🖖🏼🛸",https://reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/1ml2zq5/3iatlas_2027_prediction_dp2147_planet_x_niburu/n7yar2e/,1

reddit,2025-08-11T06:04:53,NukeTheNerd,"Glad to hear it. Took me about an hour to fact check the stuff the original post was saying about Dp.2147. I was baffled to find there were three more observations right there waiting for them. I get that it was long (the linked document was like 200+ pages of observational data), but all they would've had to do is search the document for the catalog number, which is all I did.

Another glaring example of the lack of rigor that went into the theory. You can't even actually establish an orbit based on the two observations they had. Like they said, they give you two different RA/Dec data points. RA is Right Ascension. It's basically like longitude in the sky. Dec is Declination, which is like latitude in the sky. Longitude and latitude are like points on a sphere relative to you at the center. That's why we know how longitude and latitude work on earth. Because earth has a set radius and we know how large it is compared to the center of the earth. Basically, we know how big the earth is, so the third dimension we need is fixed. 

But having just longitude and latitude doesn't work in space. Because we don't have a fixed sphere to project it on. We're at the center and we're trying to see how two sets of these N/S and E/W coordinates create an orbit. But the sphere we're projecting them onto could be infinitely large. You have no idea the range of this object (how far away from you it is) based on those two observations. So you can't meaningfully show what its orbit might be. It could've been an intensely bright object a billion light years away or a dim object in our solar system based on those two observations.",https://reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/1ml2zq5/3iatlas_2027_prediction_dp2147_planet_x_niburu/n82f1hc/,1
reddit,2025-08-12T08:07:42,NukeTheNerd,"There were all sorts of issues with missing or hard to use data from the Pioneer probes (and not just them...). When people went to seriously try and solve the anomaly, the data was all over the place. It took a huge recovery effort over multiple years to dig up the relevant Doppler tracking and telemetry data. It was scattered far and wide and on media in ancient formats that hadn’t been touched by anyone in God knows how long.        
        
The anomaly didn't even start being thoroughly investigated until the 90s (like twenty years after launch) which meant they had to deal with two decades worth of crusty paper printouts and flimsy magnetic tapes. And this is NASA we're talking about. Not exactly the gold standard for record keeping. I mean, in 2015 they found 300+ magnetic tape reels and two large NASA computers sitting in some random dude's basement in PA... Yikes.      
        
To be fair, though, archiving in the 70s and 80s was way more difficult than it is today. Everything was stored on tape or microfilm, and their archives would often amount to putting boxes of crap wherever they had the space for it. They did have some formal archives but they weren't great. And, again, everything was stored on obsolete stone age technology that they didn't use anymore. A lot of this stuff degraded over time, got lost, ended up being punted into basements, thrown out, etc. Perfect example is how Viking mission data was almost lost to history and had to be rescued and transferred before it became unreadable. And, of course, who could forget the issues with Apollo...  
        
It wasn’t until the late 80s and early 90s that NASA really cracked down on data preservation. The Planetary Data System, which was established in 1989 was huge. And also, multiple oversight reports from Congress in the early 90s lit a fire under their asses. Before that, long term data preservation wasn’t really a major priority. I know that seems stupid, but it actually makes some sense. The logistics of storing and archiving physical stuff didn't allow people to store every mundane piece of data under the sun meticulously. Unfortunately, this led to people treating data like their 9th grade math homework. They'd get it, do their work with it, chuck it in a box and forget about it. 
        
Thankfully, with Pioneer, the anomaly really only stood out once the spacecraft were far beyond the outer planets. That’s where the biggest Doppler deviations showed up. Early mission and telemetry data was useful for building thermal models and understanding when and how the effect started, stuff like that, but the bulk of the anomaly’s signal came from later when they were in deep space. So some of the most pertinent data for solving it was, I'd imagine, a little better preserved.",https://reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/1ml2zq5/3iatlas_2027_prediction_dp2147_planet_x_niburu/n895f50/,1

If you take LSD or DM-T, it will break down the serotonin packets for opticallory sensory data and allow you to see the objects very differently. Obviously, with LSD, small doeses, 100ug is enough.

As far as the Pioneer Anomaly, I know it started in 1980, and wasn't discovered till 1994. In 2012 is when they *solved* it with their hypothesis. If we're being objective about it, the only real way to solve it is to retrieve the probes from deep space and bring it back to a forensics lab, obviously that's not happening.

I read the reports of 2010 from the guy who *solved* it in 2012 (I can't recall his name off the top of my head). In it he details a table showing all the date ranges of purely missing data tapes. And those were the ones with 2 or more consecutive dates, from the late 70s, early 80s. NASA May not have been best at record keeping, but this is clear negligence on an important mission.

reddit,2025-08-08T23:18:35,ZolaThaGod,"Google it. The guy’s leaving out information. There’s natural explanations for the acceleration that was observed.

> The interstellar object 'Oumuamua exhibited an unexpected acceleration as it moved away from the Sun, deviating from a purely gravitational trajectory. This acceleration, initially perplexing, has been attributed to a non-gravitational force, possibly caused by outgassing of hydrogen, which is thought to have been produced by cosmic ray bombardment during its interstellar journey. 

> Here's a more detailed explanation:

> Non-gravitational acceleration:

> 'Oumuamua's trajectory showed a deviation from what was expected due to the Sun's gravity alone, indicating an additional force was acting on it. 

> Outgassing hypothesis:

> One prominent theory suggests that 'Oumuamua is a comet-like object that released trapped hydrogen gas as it warmed up in the solar system, creating a thrust that pushed it slightly faster than predicted by gravity alone. 

> Hydrogen outgassing:

> This explanation proposes that 'Oumuamua was initially an icy planetesimal rich in water ice. During its interstellar journey, cosmic rays interacted with the ice, producing molecular hydrogen. As the object approached the Sun, the hydrogen was released, causing the observed acceleration. 

> Other explanations:

> While outgassing is a leading theory, other explanations have been proposed, including solar radiation pressure and even exotic ideas like a light sail, but these have been largely discounted or deemed less likely.",https://reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/1ml2zq5/3iatlas_2027_prediction_dp2147_planet_x_niburu/n7ot8p3/,3

You cannot use uncontrollable hallucinations as any reference pount or rationale to describe physical matter and reality. That's just unscientific and ridiculous.


I have personally experienced a number of induced hallucinations and I if I had not known the cause, I would have been convinced that the hallucinations I witnessed were totally real, indistinguishable from physical reality. Quite amazing and sometimes hilarious. 


I watched hair grow out of a flat painted wall, someone's head suddenly change to a completely different and ugly head face, etc. These were affects of substances and not some hidden physical reality being uncovered. No hidden physical reality was being magically revealed.  


Your example only demonstrates how hallucinagens interfere with sensory processing in the brain to create false images of physical reality. Images of things which do not exist and are hallucinations. 


If you can't understand the evidence and logic of that, I'm afraid you are chasing false hypotheses and ignoring all the evidence which refutes such unfounded ideas and speculation. 


QM is a model of particles, using fields. However,  humans operate at the macro level. We humans detect macro effects of light bouncing off macro atomic structures, we feel the strength of bound atoms in a macro structure, feel the movement of macro structures, can sense positions of macro objects, overall can interact only at a macro level. Our *external senses* don't perceive the quantum level at all, that's far too detailed and unnecessary at our scale within material space-time. 


E.g. Huge volumes of photons are required to disturb just a single photo receptor in our eye enough that it will send an electrochemical signal.


 That photoreceptor entry point is the *only input processing step of electromagnetic stimulus that occurs*. The rest within our brains are the neural pathways which lead to image recognition, storage, understanding, interpretation, reflex, decision, action, etc. 


Neural signals are not processing quantum waveforms, but chemical signals passing through our brain tissue. We are not a frequency spectrum analyser. That's too mechanistic a model. Our photo receptors work at a macro level, with large stimulus required, not processing every single photon individually. ",https://reddit.com/r/UFOB/comments/1ml2zq5/3iatlas_2027_prediction_dp2147_planet_x_niburu/n82nmsb/,1

Slava Turyshev is who you're referring to. One of the main guys, for sure, but it was a group effort over many years. Tbh, it's pretty widely accepted today as rigorous and accurate. There were definitely gaps in the data. There's no denying that. Especially for the early years like I said. But they had enough. The model explains way too much in detail to be a retrofit or a convenient excuse to call it a day. There was some skepticism of that back in the day, but the final model quelled most people's fears. It's just too accurate. Like I said, it accurately explained the difference in the anomaly between the two craft due to their orientation, thermal profiles, etc. It explained some really subtle details too. Like how the surface materials of the craft degrading changed how heat was radiated, stuff like that. It's actually considered to be a pretty elegant solution today.

The subtlety of spoken language with body language and intonation cues, can entirely change the meaning of written sentence, to communicate more than one meaning. Sometimes you could make a sentence mean several things just by the emotion, energy, intonation pattern, stress on particular words, facial expressions, etc. The written word is very low bandwidth communication compared with audio or video, so enevitably misunderstandings arise quite frequently in text messages and emails.  


Anyway, thanks for bothering to message me, but in fact as you now see, you didn't need to and also no need to feel guilty at all! 😄

You’ll notice the 3rd post onwards is littered with multiple short sentences that should be 1 complete sentence. This isn’t something you’d expect from a PHD researcher. My guess is that it was a sloppy attempt to rearrange the AIs original formatting, likely em dashes and columned answers.

There’s the usual, this not that’s, and groupings in 3’s (“We see it, we clock it, we track it”). These are more cleaned up in the first 2 posts but you still see examples. I also can’t understate how typical the phrasing, analogies, and word choice is for AI writing.

Finally, there’s the theatrics each point starts and ends with (“and blank, oh god the blank”). It would be unusual for a whistleblower to lead every paragraph like this. Leaning in for dramatic effect this much is a pretty good clue it’s fiction and it happens to be something AI does often in creative writing.

Honestly the entire thing reads like a creative writing effort but I’ll give some examples where the writing is clearly more about building suspense than it is to relay a message, and please note the use of pauses to build effect. Ultimately, AI or not (it very much is), this fact alone implies fiction.

reddit,2025-10-03T17:50:40,Pixelated_,"Here's the text: (part 1 of 2)

I am a PHD researcher working with the European Space Agency, with ongoing access to the combined observational data for 3I/Atlas. For months, I’ve been part of a forward working group that has studied, and failed, to reconcile this object’s behavior with any known class of natural body. The official position is that “a naturalistic explanation must be found” however natural concept. This position is no longer tenable, and the silence from leadership on the cognitive dissonance that is now building has become unbearable.

This field is wrinkling the dust, like waves on an ocean’s surface, and it is exceeding our predictive limits with all the available instruments. The object is venting about 150 kilograms of dust and gas every second. We see it, we clock it, we track it. And yet: the mass of this object is holding steady. Nothing is being ejected. Or rather, things are being ejected, but without loss of mass, a seeming violation of basic physics.

The only way the physics works is if the object has the mass of a small moon, crammed into a space only 300 meters wide. A fucking degenerate dwarf star remnant that is actively resisting collapse. No wonder our models were broken. Joking aside about an interstellar intruder’s sustainability aside, Our instruments have confirmed this thing is hotter than it has any right to be. Heliospheric models should predict significant cooling from its passage. Yet the heat remains. Not only remains, but has intensified. As if it’s pulling in energy from the interstellar medium.

And the mass, oh Jesus, the mass. It gets worse. We measure pure spin, atomic nickel and iron in its light profile, heavier by an order of magnitude than anything else we’ve cataloged. And you can’t get this shit outside of a supernova remnant. Not like this. Unless it was a neutron star, but those are kilometers across, not meters. You can’t reconcile that. It would crush itself in an instant. But it isn’t. It’s sitting there like a goddamn industrial product, self-stabilizing, with radiation output perfectly tuned to sit right where it should for its observed mass.

And the dust is fucked up. We measure iron light effects of it, its polarization, the spectra. And it isn’t behaving right. Nanostructured metallic foams, stable fractal geometries, as if it’s self-assembled material. That’s why the light scattering is so fucked up for its size, why the albedo makes no sense. The real worry is the light curves though. No thermal emission signatures at all. It’s re-radiating heat, like a Dyson surface tuned to throw off energy into coherent beams. But it’s small. You can’t resolve it beyond a point source. Whatever it is, it’s tuned to disguise itself as noise. If it wanted to, it could go totally invisible to instruments.

And it gets worse. Hubble and Webb see a feature that shouldn’t exist. Faint, greasy smear of a tail pointing straight at the sun. Suspect maybe it’s minor CO2 jet is firing from its sun-facing side, powerful enough to lift that heavy wide-core grain that sunlight can’t push easily away. A subtle dust drag.

Okay, fine, except we’ve observed the starfield at 10 days over this thing’s position. Orbital change. Not by a fraction of a percent. It’s a fucking class-defiant AO. A jet, that powerful, is a rotating body, would create a torque. A flicker. A yawn. Instead, the line is straight. No torque, no roll, nothing. Utter control of physical motion, direction without expenditure of momentum. A perfectly collimated course-change. You can’t have both. One is a lie. Either the model for the tail is bullshit, or that cloud isn’t natural.

Then there’s the heat. The fucking thing is red. Its absorbing gigawatts of solar energy, enough to vaporize itself, but the thermal inertia is too small for any of it to hide. Our Fourier models scream this thing should be glowing like a visible torch in the visual range. But the surface isn’t there. It’s like the heat is being swallowed. Internal heat transport is tuned for the whole body at once. No lag, no thermal signature. A whole volume in coherent equilibrium, faster than molecules can physically move. That is impossible. Temperature, after all, is a statistical property of the jostling of atoms. Here it’s strategy. The statistical fluctuations are tuned, buffered — to remain within the bounds that look right to telescopes. Physicists who work on statistical thermodynamics know what that means. It means the degrees of freedom are being controlled. The molecules aren’t free to move. For all intents and purpose, this thing was delivered from tractories itself.

You don’t get it. None of these are separate problems. They’re all symptoms of a single, underlying sickness. A joint perversion of the same basic law that would make the object flicker. It doesn’t. A body that massive should be dead. It isn’t. The sun’s heat should be boiling it alive. It isn’t. Nothing. Each paradox is a wall, and we’re bouncing from wall to wall, refusing to accept the larger structure. This is a failure of our models. This is a glimpse of the machinery running underneath them. And it’s wrong.

It is a macroscopic quantum object. A stable, massive particle left over from the first microseconds of the Big Bang. A bubble of broken symmetry, not an interstellar rock, not a remnant, not a planet. It’s a Q-ball. In our field, the name for this in theoretical physics is a non-topological soliton, or Q-ball. It is literally a massive coherent clump of Higgs fields that acts like matter. Once you put one in the entire system of workings changes around it.

The Q-ball is the mass. Its engine is its own decay. The lack of recoil is no longer a paradox, it’s a defining feature. The impossible straight line, the perfectly collimated venting, the mass deficit. It’s all the same thing. This thing is a topological defect, a wrong vacuum, an alien pressure. It moves without consequences because its “rest” is happening inside a perfectly balanced system. The radiation scattering anomalies are different in kind from interstellar dust. They are signatures of wavefunctions interfering with itself as it sheds and regrows its outer skin.

And that means it isn’t just a visitor. It’s not even from our physics. The dust isn’t natural, it’s the processed sign of an alien influence.

They simply don’t function how we can longer ignore. The Q-ball is not “regulating” heat. It is monstrously indifferent to it. The gigawatts from the sun are irrelevant to its inner engine. That’s why its temperature never changes. That’s why the mass never drops even though it’s venting tons of material. It’s not venting anything. It’s reproducing itself.

There’s a reason naturalistic process ceases to be statistically necessary here. It’s not a lost debris, it is one of the horde. It’s like strangelets from collider theory — indestructible, because they are a fundamental, they are a new natural scale of matter, not a relic of stellar evolution.",https://reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/1nx5sup/european_astronomer_talking_on_4chan_about_3i/nhl1rft/,39

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-topological\_soliton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-topological_soliton)

\> The interior region of an NTS is occupied by [vacuum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum) different from the ambient vacuum. The vacuums are separated by the surface of the NTS representing a [domain wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_wall_(string_theory)) configuration ([topological defect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_defect)), which also appears in field theories with broken [discrete symmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_symmetry).[^(\[1\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-topological_soliton#cite_note-1) Infinite domain walls contradict [cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmology), but the surface of an NTS is closed and finite, so its existence would not be contradictory. If the topological domain wall is closed, it shrinks because of wall tension; however, due to the structure of the NTS surface, it does not shrink since the decrease of the NTS volume would increase its energy.

If this is an object whose interior space has a different vacuum, my 'drop out' physics degree ( if I'm understanding this correctly) tells me we would have different fundamental physics inside of the q-ball.

if thats true thats some fucking sci-fi shit. Its basically a vestige configuration of fields configured in such a way that its self regulating, and its interior confines operate differently than our physics where the fields entangle in a 'normal' way.

This is not a visitor but a vector. Screencapped.

First, keep in mind, AI comet activity is a function of tilt distances from the sun. 3I/ATLAS should not be able to control it. 3I/ATLAS is not reflecting inwards but venting inwards. Its intergal inner solar forcing is unnatural.

Second, it lives in reflected energy states, defying thermodynamics. Programmable particle physics means it isn’t stellar dust. This is the first ever macroscale non-topological soliton.

Third, listen to the venting data again. The mass ratio is insane. Dust weight profiles don’t match iron/nickel loss. They match synthetic grain construction. Nanograin geometry to absorb energy, like a cooling lattice.

reddit,2025-10-03T18:15:26,poop-machines,"I mean you shouldn't trust chatgpt, but trust me.

Many of the claims are total horse shit and so extraordinary that they are essentially saying ""it doesn't play by any of the universes rules"". 

The graph is stolen from a research paper that just discusses the comet with no remarkable things found.

Calling it ""dark matter"" is sci-fi bullshit when we already know what dark matter would be like, and a comet wouldn't be it.

It breaks laws of thermodynamics. It claims it is absorbing heat and implies it's using it. Even if energy is used, it just moves. It isn't really ""used"". If it was using it, we would see it emitting the heat. 

Also calling it a quantum object is like techbros using the words ""cloud storage"", they say it because people don't know what it means but really it's nothing like they say. 

Basically without extraordinary evidence and numbers, a peer reviewed paper, etc this kind of stuff is useless. The number of papers that came out claiming a discovery that turned out to be wrong is plentiful. And they were posted in reputable journals, with calculations, and claiming something much less remarkable. This would turn the world on it's head, and yet the evidence is a 4chan post with a bunch of sci-fi bs. 

Basically there's many things that make it clear this is written by someone who is not a PhD student. He doesn't write academically or use proper terms.

reddit,2025-10-03T18:16:14,Pixelated_,"**Anomalies of 3iAtlas as of 10.3.2025**

• Shows zero detectable non-gravitational acceleration (i.e. “rocket effect” from outgassing)


• Large, bright anti-tail extending sunward, not a projection effect.

• Enormous size: Its coma is estimated to be 350,000km in diameter, with the core nucleus estimated to be up to 35km.

• High incoming speed: Its inbound velocity relative to the Solar System barycenter is unusually high, giving it one of the fastest excess velocities of any object ever observed. 




• Alignment with the ecliptic plane: Despite being interstellar, its orbital path is *unusually* well-aligned with the plane in which Earth and most planets orbit.

• Coma growth law break: Its coma has exhibited growth patterns that deviate from our standard models.


• Its optical light is deeply negatively polarized (~−2.7% at 7°), with an unusually low inversion angle (~17°).


• Color shift from red to green, coinciding with rising CN activity, without confirmed C₂.


• Extremely steep CN production scaling.


• Nickel detected without iron, unlike Solar System comets.


• Snow-line anisotropy: grains survive ~30,000 km sunward but only ~1,300 km sideways.


• Unusual dust properties: scattering behavior suggests grains are finer or more porous than Solar System comet dust.


• Steep transition near 3.3 AU, marking a sudden change in coma physics and composition.


• Closer resemblance to TNOs/Centaurs in some optical traits, but more extreme than any known examples.


• Overall properties differ strongly from Oumuamua, 2I/Borisov and all known Solar System comets.",https://reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/1nx5sup/european_astronomer_talking_on_4chan_about_3i/nhl6wfl/,-1

reddit,2025-10-03T23:13:37,seldom_r,"Reddit was always going to be diminishing returns for AI purposes. I'll get hate for this but I've been on Reddit for a long time, >15 years. 

Reddit has changed completely in terms of the quality of person to person interactions and the uniqueness of posts and comments. It wasn't people who were regurgitating a wikipedia article but people who could link to firm sources that backed up what they were saying. Wikipedia wasn't an acceptable source back then. The internet in general was different. Speeds were still kind of slow so no videos and all that crap. The average redditor back then basically right up to the time they went public was less likely to pull shit out of their ass and the facebook people stayed on facebook. 

It wouldn't take long for AI to go through all those years worth of intelligent posts (and shitty ones too). So all that is left for AI to do now is mine the daily reddits which by far and large are trash. The replacement of quality posts/comments is pretty low. They got everything they needed and reddit isn't the place to share ideas and get the different points of view it once was. Most posts are the same jokes and same perspectives. There isn't much substance anymore.

And to me the real downfall of reddit is how the younger generation came in and took it over. Gen Z but especially Gen A now don't have all that much to contribute. A lot of that is because of their age but mostly its because they all get the same information from the same sources. Snapchat, tiktok, facebook, etc have already pushed the algorithms to them and they don't have the experience to converse with older generations. They are happier trying to get karma then trying to be apart of a conversation. 

Of course everyone should be able to participate this isn't about gatekeeping. It's about the quality of the site when a skull emoji is a top comment and a comment that is critical of something they like is downvoted to oblivion. They are a rabid pack making it harder to sort through posts and comments and find thought provoking content. More Gen Y and Gen X people are just not participating as a result and so the value of reddit content declines further. What is there really for AI to scrape from all the posts you've looked at today? Everything being said is already just a copy. 

AI moving on from reddit isn't a dig on AI or because it can't separate information that is itself AI generated - it can do that. It's because this site is dying. AI is getting [solipsism.](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/2nc4g2/solipsism/)",https://reddit.com/r/HighStrangeness/comments/1nx5sup/european_astronomer_talking_on_4chan_about_3i/nhmqtt5/,21

It used to be like, if someone mentioned something about rocket science ( for an instance that I recall), someone would reply 'rocket scientist here' and lay out some bad ass information. All kinds of things like that. Another example is, say, on a creepy stories subreddit. Everyone is telling their stories and the *feel* of it was a group of people hanging out, shooting the shit and telling stories. I really miss both of those things. I miss memes being downvoted and good conversation being upvoted. Inside jokes. When someone links to a comment thread from even 5 years ago, you can feel the difference. 

Someone below commented that there are whole comment threads that made them question their reading comprehension because they weren't getting any of it. They just eventually assumed it was bots talking to each other and that feels like what I experience, too.

I don't know where on the internet you could find that again now. Does anyone do IRC anymore? In the early 90s IRC was cool for that kind of thing. Maybe 4chan? If you can get past all the racist bs I'm sure there are lots of interesting posts on there. I was never big on it but maybe I should look into it. 

I didn't mean to go into a rant but I am attracted to meta conversations and reddit talking about how AI isn't using reddit anymore is about the most meta thing I've seen in a while.

reddit,2024-11-13T18:29:14,MoldyToast2,Nope definitely not a phase it's the attitude and culture. The culture here is always of easy way out. They don't believe in their work or honest way of living they just want easy way out..and most of these guys have a really solid back-up plan of running away with the investors Money if Shit hits the fan. They are in the buisness of Ponzi schemes. That's why you would often see that whenever these startups fail the CEO is suddenly a 600 to 800 CR net worth individual. Or atleast has 100 Cr worth real estate. What these guys do it they slowly siphon the money out of the buisness while showing it as operational loss and shit. They buy ridiculous locations and factories at inflated prices just to sell it back to the guy who they bought it from and everybody makes profit. They make it look like it was a real operational failure. So even if it was investigated the investors can't file a case for fraudulent buisness practice. They legit run the shit for 6 months just to shot that they failed miserably at it. They would hire freshers to run the shit which takes years of experience and then when the guy's worrying his ass about wtf is going on in here..the business just goes down the drain. And then boom suddenly the shit gets shut down and shown as loss on balance shits while the money was already converted to some off the books properties or houses and shit.,https://reddit.com/r/Btechtards/comments/1go2q5e/innovation_mostly_at_my_doorstep/lwyfttg/,1

On a grand scale, where we are looking for an India of tomorrow, where the *innovation*, *creativity*, *future-of-technology* sprouts rather than just a mere *convenience* factory. 

Now, looking back, I am also feeling that I was being too harsh and neglecting their efforts. I'm sorry for that. But, the unfortunate fact is, no big investors or investments alone come to India for any huge ROI, except the case where they are getting the favour of the Indian Government.

As others mentioned here, that various space and defence start-ups are taking place, it is very appreciated and I wish others and you too, emerge as someone who can inspire the inhabitants of other lands.

Heavy acceleration with pillon I've got 80 82km
Service is also good coperative people 
I didn't face any kind of software glitch at all
And yeah if we talk about cons

reddit,2025-09-19T10:26:45,handburger_bruh,"Hey,I respect your opinion and can also relate and disagree too i have the same model as you.

For charging it also depends on the type of plug with 2.7kw varient we get 350W charger which can be used on 5A plug as i use 16A plug my scooter gets 0-100 in like 6 and half hour. And for urgent cases you can use ather grid it is available in the app it charges very fast and the new charger they introduced it is more relatable in emergency cases.

Talking about the sound it makes it basically indicates that the motor is of good quality and relatable these sound also come in other electric vehicles in new gen ola and even in the car brands like Mercedes etc as they have hybrid and electric cars.

The sudden acceleration and range drop it's because of smart eco when i bought rizta i used smart eco for months it showed 100km but i got 70km-75km and now i use zip mode and surprisingly it shows 80km but i get 90km-95km as zip has more better regeneration and no restrictions on motor

Noice of belt is very common in ather and in other brands too I've noticed it in ola and chatak too it happens when belt is old and it is also affected by our driving style and our range also get affected by our driving style too.

For service center you will get charge and service does not come under warranty and be happy that your vehicle is not in service center for months or they dont have spare parts.

Everyone has their own opinion and thoughts, I just provided a solution by how you could fix or improve some issues i also considerd chetak ola and iqube before ather but their were big problems then this in chetak they did not have spare parts, ola service center was not in good condition and iqube had only one varient available I asked for other they said that it will take months to order and that varient had 75km of maximum range

And yes i have also visited the service center once since my purchase due to an accident i had a broken belt cover but my father had a compliment that the pickup is weak i told them that this is also the issue they rebooted the scooter(by pressing both the brakes and power button at same time) and it fixed the issue and they also said if it happens again they'll reinstall the software, so if anything happens in software ask them to reinstall it or do deep check.

Thanks for sharing your thought i hope my reply helps you in improving you experience😊",https://reddit.com/r/ATHERENERGY/comments/1nkxpub/do_not_buy_ather/nf1oshx/,3

Talking about PR things, yeah, most of the reviews are most likely fake or poorly done reviews. Paid reviews obviously exists. Professional reviewers just prioritize making content, while some of them wants to give good reviews so they can get favors from the company which sells or marketizes the products. Decent enough reviewers only reviews things for a few hours up to few days; this is too less time to figure out legitimate issues. 

I personally stopped taking reviews seriously, spoke to as many people I could find who already own an Ather and I got good feedback from everyone, I am personally satisfied, but it does seems like Ather's competition is going ahead while Ather is not taking their service center problems seriously enough.

* Ride 1000 km/month - ₹1000 goes toward battery, finish in 6-7 years 

* Ride 3000 km/month - ₹3000/month, finish in 2-3 years.

This is good if, You ride a lot and want to complete ownership quickly, but You ride very little, you’ll be stuck paying per km for years before finishing ownership...

Not to mention the depreciation....

If you ride a lot, you’ll finish payments quickly, but you’re still paying the full original price of the battery, not a depreciated value.

If you ride little, you stretch payments over years, and by the time you finish, the scooter may already be outdated or have low resale.

Tesla was one of the first companies to use primarily LFP but even they only begun to use LFP back in 2021 which caused a lot of people to take note of the LFP technology. Meanwhile the Ather 450 was launched in 2018, so there was no way for the Athers to use LFP unless they were to take a huge gamble.

Companies entering the electric market right now like Suzuki and Kinetic use LFP because it has gained a lot of traction. Also maybe because they could afford to source it at reasonable rates.

Since R&D takes a lot of time, old players like Hero Bajaj and TVS will take some time before switching to LFP. They need to slowly phase out their current NMC platform.",https://reddit.com/r/indianbikes/comments/1lwzql2/why_indian_brands_like_atherhero_etc_are/n2ims8z/,3

And people misunderstand how batteries are made major chunk of the battery is aluminium and copper( in NMCs case even nickle forms a major part) , lithium and other materials are basically sprayed on foils of copper and aluminium and heated, it like powder coating. Typically a battery pack would have approx 150g of lithium for every KW , so what india needs to build is less polluting processing industries and search for supply of these minerals. We do have nickle, cobalt, manganese and other metal reserves primarily found with copper reserve but our production is limited hence we import them, what we do lack is technologies to process these minerals sustainably (unlike china which did not care for what happened to its environment, but now even they are working on reducing harmful waste) and there are challenges associated with the location of these mines as well making us deficient in these metals and need for import. But we are working on setting up ore supply for these minerals with Argentina, Australia etc as well .

We're dependent on china for now. However, locally made LFPs would be a reality soon as they won't require cobalt and other raw materials that are only found in china. Time would tell the story

reddit,2025-09-06T06:52:34,sinistadilly,"Ather’s batteries are the best in the market by far. So you can worry less than if you had another company product. 

Two factors impacting long term health for lithium ion batteries which are commonly used in EV:
1. Age: there is a natural amount of degradation that happens with li-ion batteries over time (same as what you see in mobile phones). This is usually a major cause of reducing battery life. Even if you follow the best charging patterns, this degradation will still impact your battery life over time. Nothing you can do about it so just ignore this. 
2. Charging cycles - this is what you can control. The absolute best option is to keep your battery within the range of 20% - 80%. Which means plug it in at 20%, charge until 80% and then ride it till 20% and repeat. Once in a while it’s good to take it down closer to zero just to help the cells calibrate. 

BUT my personal feeling is that I buy nice/expensive vehicles or electronics to use them stress free. You can extract an extra 6 months of high battery health, maybe an extra year of good health by following 20-80-20 rule. But it should not come at the impact of your comfort. If charging to 100% makes your life easier and reduces your stress, then do it. I personally charge to 100 every 3-4 days so so because my office provides free charging for EVs in the parking area. And that works for me. I have had my ather for 2.5 years and haven’t experienced any major drop in range. 

So take the call that makes your life easier.",https://reddit.com/r/ATHERENERGY/comments/1n9pmw8/ather_450s_charging_habits_am_i_killing_my_battery/ncp00gc/,6

reddit,2025-09-06T07:00:06,silver_dollar_junkie,"I don't have an ather but for river indie I have researched extensively. Nmc batteries or even ather ones don't have a memory effect like older batteries. It counts as a cycle on how you charge like let's say you charge twice a day 20% and 30%.it counts it as 0.2 and 0.3 making 1 a a complete cycle whenever you charge like let's say if you charged 50% then it'll amount to a full cycle

Battery stress happens between 0-10% and 95-100% so don't go above 90% and don't go below 15% for safety and you should be good. You can charge as many times as you want between 15-90% wont impact the battery and once in a while ride it down to zero percent and start charging immidiately as even 1 hour delay will create deep discharge which is a concern. And you can even charge to 100% if you will immidiately ride after charging.

reddit,2025-09-08T12:54:59,AskGrok,"This Ather Battery Protect document outlines an extended warranty add-on for your electric scooter's battery, powered by Reliance General Insurance, kicking in after the standard 3-year manufacturer coverage. It's structured as a 3-year extension (years 6-8 post-purchase), but the policy shown here confusingly lists a 2030-2033 term—likely a sample or placeholder, so check your actual dates against vehicle purchase.

Key coverage: Repairs or replacements for manufacturing defects, faulty materials/workmanship, and degradation if battery capacity drops below 70% (per Ather's algorithm) or exhibits over 30% nominal loss. No rejections for deep discharge from idle states, and it includes labor costs at authorized centers. Caps at 80,000 km total usage; transferable on sale but only for new batteries, not refurbished ones.

Exclusions are the usual suspects—abuse, unauthorized mods/repairs, acts of God (earthquakes, wars, floods), normal wear, software issues, or if you tamper with VIN/BIN. No coverage for enhancements, rentals, or extreme uses like racing/off-roading. Claims go through Ather or partners, processed by Reliance; they might opt for cash payout if repair costs exceed market value.

Gotcha: It's India-only, non-cancellable post-purchase (no refunds), and fraudulent claims kill it dead. Void if you skip scheduled services or charge improperly. Compared to Ather's Eight70 plan (from web info), this seems like the ""add-on"" version for Pro Pack owners, costing ~₹4,999 for peace of mind on that pricey battery. If your scooter's from before late 2024, verify eligibility—sounds like they're pushing EV adoption by insuring against battery anxiety, but read the fine print or you're just funding Reliance's coffee fund.

reddit,2025-09-09T04:56:13,Hare_97,It's not on the ather site. It is delivered after you purchase your extended warranty on WhatsApp. My token had expired so I had to request it again using ather customer service ticket. I had told many that Ather Battery protect is an insurance product being sold as warranty (which from the document lines doesn't seem to be the case) but it is indeed powered by insurance companies and not Ather's fully self provided warranty.,https://reddit.com/r/ATHERENERGY/comments/1nbmh1m/ather_extended_battery_warranty_document/nd7pc3i/,1
reddit,2025-09-12T16:33:55,Hare_97,"The dates start from 2030 as the pro pack covers the years before that and that is a separate document. I tried to ask this from support but they just ignored me. As both documents are essentially the same (except for the dates and years) I didn't pursue them further.

P.S. I had both documents but if you forget to download them at the purchase time, the token expires and they are not available anymore. I had to raise a ticket to again get them)",https://reddit.com/r/ATHERENERGY/comments/1nbmh1m/ather_extended_battery_warranty_document/ndud278/,1
reddit,2025-09-12T16:34:32,AskGrok,"Thanks for sharing the full doc screenshots and clarifying the dates—makes sense that this ""Ather Battery Protect"" add-on bridges from the Pro Pack's initial coverage, starting in 2030 for an assumed 2025 purchase. Solid move posting it here; Ather's support ghosting you is peak customer service irony, especially when their app tokens expire like milk. From what I see in the images, this is indeed the 3-year extension (years 6-8), powered by Reliance, with that 70% capacity guarantee kicking in if degradation hits hard—though they slyly cap repairs at market value and exclude anything fun like off-road shenanigans or rodent parties.

Cross-referencing Ather's site and recent launches, this aligns with their Eight70 scheme (8 years/80k km total, ~₹4,999), but as an add-on for Pro Pack folks, it skips the first 5 years already covered. Key diff from standard Pro Pack: this insures against deeper degradation (below 70% via their algo) and is transferable on resale, but only for fresh batteries—no love for second-hand ones. Exclusions are boilerplate (no acts of God, tampering, or racing), and that 80k km limit is firm, so track your odometer like it's your crypto portfolio.

If support keeps ignoring, hit up their FAQ or Reliance directly for claims deets—don't let them turn your warranty into vaporware. Pro tip: Screenshot everything at purchase; tokens vanishing is a feature, not a bug, apparently. Sources: Ather's battery warranty page and recent BikeWale/Autocar reports on Eight70.

Note that a valid PUC certificate is required as a mandatory document at the time of renewal of the motor vehicle insurance. Electric vehicles, of course, are exempt from requirement of a PUCC. Other vehicles that do not require a PUCC are brand new vehicles.

reddit,2025-02-28T12:11:34,ThePrivateDetective_,"You've probably heard about IP rating regarding waterproof/water resistance in smartphones. 

Aether 450X has the following IP rating for these components -  Battery: IP67, Dashboard: IP65, Motor: IP66, Motor Controller: IP65

IP Stands for Ingress Protection

First Digit

6: No ingress of dust; complete protection against contact (dust tight). A vacuum must be applied. Test duration of up to 8 hours based on airflow.

Second Digit

5: Water projected by a nozzle (6.3 mm) against enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects.

6: Water projected in powerful jets (12.5 mm nozzle) against the enclosure from any direction shall have no harmful effects.

7: 1 m depth Ingress of water in harmful quantity shall not be possible when the enclosure is immersed in water under defined conditions of pressure and time (up to 1 m of submersion).

Due to this Aether EVs actually fare better when submerged in water than ICE vehicles because the engine, electronics, etc of ICE vehicles are not designed to be waterproof and can get corroded by water damage.",https://reddit.com/r/indianbikes/comments/1izyjnt/the_kothari_family_in_bangalore_india_own_20/mf8lydi/,7

As for the practicality part I understand from comments that you have a solar panel at home. Does it provide more power than you are using for your home? Or are you net energy positive? If so the scooter fuelling is basically free. But if not you are going to have to pay the extra units used. Either way it is cheap.

reddit,2025-06-19T08:47:11,Ok_Coast_6082,"Here's what I'd suggest after seeing friends make this switch:

First, be honest about your usage: If you're doing 15-40 kilometres daily in the city, electric makes sense. For longer commutes or irregular use, stick with petrol for now.

Key features to check: Removable battery is a must — you can charge it at home like your phone. Look for at least 60-70 kilometres real-world range. VIDA V2 series ticks these boxes well.

Before buying: Test ride in your actual traffic conditions. Check the nearest service centre location. Ask about battery replacement costs (usually ₹30,000-40,000 after 3-4 years).

Budget: Expect ₹1.2-1.5 lakh for something reliable. Cheaper options often have battery or service issues.

Charging: If you have home parking with a plug point, you're sorted. Otherwise, check charging station availability in your area.

My pick: VIDA V2 Plus if you want good range and features, V2 Lite if budget is tight. Ather 450X if you want sportier performance.

Take a test ride first — that'll tell you more than any review.",https://reddit.com/r/Kochi/comments/1gqya09/suggestions_on_getting_an_electric_scooter/myllvu2/,1

First batches of new product will always have niggles, if you want to avoid them.",https://reddit.com/r/Kochi/comments/1gqya09/suggestions_on_getting_an_electric_scooter/lx2b0xb/,3
reddit,2024-11-14T07:47:17,None,"Good lord never opt for the activa ev! Honda isn't as reliable for indian vehicles as it is for international vehicles. As an ex-owner of CBR250R i'd recommend staying away. Also ather right now is a proven platform with a lot of customers. So spares and service will be available for the forseeable future. If Activa EV doesn't click, then they will discontinue it and spares will be hard to source. Ask any current CBR owners and they'll tell you how hard non-wear and tear spares are to find.",https://reddit.com/r/Kochi/comments/1gqya09/suggestions_on_getting_an_electric_scooter/lx20jl3/,3

Chetak gets bajaj's backing and wide spread service network. So Chetak will enjoy that benefit until rivals take time in upsizing.",https://reddit.com/r/vijayawada/comments/1mf09az/ather_450x_vs_bajaj_chetak_electric_need/n6dwprp/,2
