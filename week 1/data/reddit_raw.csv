reddit,2025-10-12T16:30:06,No-man_show,"My point with accessories and insurance was from self perspective after owning a vehicle over 1 year and getting another one this year .
Buying insurance from Dealership won't do any good as they have customized plans and their commissions added .
I went with my research and bought Acko last year which helped in 2 accidental damages worth more than 20k together .
Dealership were giving me same coverage like the package at around 9.5k where I got it under 6.9k using Amazon pay gift cards and used Amazon pay while paying to insurance.
Last year dealership recommended me Godigit ,this year they pushed for Tata Aig , reason - Better commission for them .
So never buy an insurance based on suggestions from dealership.If you want a true picture ,visit service centre , they will tell you who pays and actually don't keep them hanged during reimbursement claims .
About safety gears , It costed me about 3.5 including installation but got the entire body protected with additional structure , which helped me in one accident , same when I compared with brand accessory was of poor quality and could have costed more .
I initially wanted to get foot rest but dealership didn't had the stock for more than 3 months and they never bothered to revert when requested them.
So the money you are saving you can add to get better safety gears for protection of you and your vehicle .

reddit,2025-10-11T09:31:09,1PerpetuallyAnxious,"Take test drives for 450x and Rizta, both. I don't know where you're based, but I assume your city also has pothole filled roads, make sure to test drive on the worst roads for a good 15-20 mins. This will give you an idea of comfort. Rizta might give you better comfort for a 30 km ride in heavy traffic, but this is purely up to your personal preference.

I have to do 4 trips of 10 km each everyday through little to no traffic and went with Ather 450x 3.9kW. The fuel expense was burning a hole in my pocket and it was heartbreaking to see my 3rd most largest expense after rent and food was fuel.

I've barely spent 40 Rs. in charging cost and already travelled 250+ km on the Ather. Check out your local EV charging points whether Ather grid or other plug and pay outlets. Get an idea if they're working, being maintained, and if you have plenty of options around. Same for your college locality. Always plan ahead as a worst case scenario backup. If you feel you're covered on the charging points front, you can explore the EV option.

I absolutely love the ride on the Ather and have no regrets over this model. It's so light that my sister and my SO both enjoy it and say it's easy to handle. My sister is now planning to get the same model for herself.

reddit,2025-10-13T18:14:19,TemuPacemaker,"BMW i4 or Merc CLA?

I'll skip all the standard questions because I have a good idea of what I want and have done the research. It basically comes down to these two (or a base short-range A6, but that seems like it would be worse in every way other than maybe isolation, which isn't something I even want anyway).

Within the budget I can get an eDrive40 with ///M adaptive steering and suspension, ACC with stop & go, and parking assist with 360 cameras. White free paint. The CLA, on the other hand, could be an almost maxed out 350 4matic, sans the cosmetic AMG package or the stupid passenger screen.

I'm having a hard time deciding between these two. Normally I'd think myself as more of an ""ultimate driving machine guy"" but this is a giant heavy EV that I won't track, so does that really matter? I tested an i4 m50 and the CLA 350 a few weeks apart, and while the BMW did feel a bit faster, it wasn't *that* much (\~3.7 to 100km vs 4.6s for CLA, eDrive40 would be slower), I couldn't say the suspension and steering were night and day without driving them back to back. I'd also need to get stickier tires to get more out of them, thus ruining the range.

**Pros I4**

* Sportier steering/suspension?
* Design (other than grille, but CLA isn't better)
* Interior design and UX, some real buttons
* Quieter
* Liftback
* Normal roof

**Pros CLA**

* Quicker
* Longer range
* Faster charging
* More gadgets

Has anyone tried both? Any things to consider?

E: I'm aware the CLA doesn't support 400V charging but seems like it should be ok here. Neither support V2L unfortunately but I'll live with that.

I’m after something sporty/coupe-style but still roomy (compact SUV is fine, but I would prefer a sporty sedan or liftback) with a premium interior.

On my shortlist right now:

Volvo ES90
Audi S6 Sportback
Polestar 4 (I seriously love the Polestar 5, but it’s out of budget with the current price tag)
I’ve never owned a Volvo or PS, so here are a few things I’m really curious about:

How do they “feel” compared to Audi, in handling, ride quality, interior quality, responsiveness, refinement?
Do Volvo or PS models offer a feature like Audi’s adaptive pilot assist that automatically adjusts to speed limits? I really like this on my Audi and use it daily. I did some research and sounds like Polestar has such feature but not Volvo EV models, which is confusing (e.g., XC90 documentation mentions ASL, but not ES90…)
How is driving in winter/snow?

Emphasis mine. ""Ambitions"" is the critical word.

Spruiking figures from the last 6 months is meaningless when the ""opposing"" article is forward looking and focused on changes to the regulatory environment and it's impacts into the future.



Also worth noting that the pullback in regulation WSJ is pointing to is predominantly pure BEV-impacting - whereas the Rho Motion report Electrek is getting their figures from includes both BEV *and* PHEV in its figures, which were stagnant in china but still saw substantial growth in the other critical markets.

That regulatory softening is likely to further drive PHEV sales, so the Rho Motion view of EVs is probably quite rosy - because PHEVs are the winner in that scenario (and only a basement dwelling idealist would claim that's a bad thing in context).

You won't find that caveat mentioned anywhere in the Electrek article though, of course - usually they sneakily throw in ""Rho Motion includes all plug-ins"" or ""Includes PHEVs"" in the 2nd last paragraph where most of their readers won't reach; this time it's been omitted altogether.

Also worth noting that the one forward looking part of the Rho motion report was what will happen next quarter - and it's predicting a pullback after the end of EV tax credits.

You're handwaving something that has been agreed - the pausing of the emissions mandate - because of a desire that has been expressed - lowering Tariffs on Chinese cars. Equating those as equal in opposing effect is a gross misrepresentation.

Even assuming there's a change to Tariffs, it's unlikely to occur this side of the new year, and even then there's substantial time required to actually spin up a distribution presence and decide on/homologate a product mix.

And that's assuming it happens at all, being a move that has considerable political capital attached.

If you're suggesting the above indicates there's no negative impact or reduced ambition for EVs in Canada, it's an extremely weak argument.


>For the EU, In the last meeting between the EU automakers and EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, the EU automakers wanted the mandate pushed back but Ursula von der Leyen was unwilling to budge on the mandate

Sorry but things are moving fast in the EU since early September.

[Late September Von Der Leyen said she was open to some form of technological neutrality for the auto industry](https://www.autoweek.com/news/a68037064/eu-reconsiders-2035-internal-combustion-ban/), [whilst as recently as last week Germany's Merz was steadfastly opposed to a hard cut-off. ](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/climate-energy/germanys-merz-heads-auto-execs-meeting-without-unified-stance-eus-2035-target-2025-10-09/)

And there's still plenty of time before December.

The risk is that if it pushes too hard against consumer desires, not only will the target not be reached, but the parties capable and interested of having *some* sort of target will be voted out in favour of those that have *zero* interest in setting targets.

We're increasingly seeing that populist extreme right gain traction throughout europe; the risk is that letting perfect be the enemy of good will cause a collapse in targets rather than a pullback - and that feeds into the reality of EVs in EU.



UK has paused/pushed back/watered down their mandates, and whilst developing nations with specific geopolitical reasons to push for energy independence like Nepal and Ethiopia are seeing adoption increase, they're not exactly powerhouses of personal transport.

To be clear - the WSJ article isn't saying EVs are disappearing, it's pointing out that there are genuine headwinds in the regulatory space, and they're right.

No offense, but you are doing the exact same with the EU mandate when you say, ""Von Der Leyen said she was open to some form of technological neutrality for the auto industry.""  **As per your logic, nothing was agreed to yet.**  And even though Merz is trying to push the mandate back, there are other countries in the EU that are opposed to the 2035 mandate being pushed back.

Again, I can't read the WSJ article because it's paywalled, but the dropping price and of EVs, and increased range and faster charging times, will also speed up the adoption of them.  Also, BYD is building factories abroad, to avoid tariffs, and once those factories get up and running, it will speed up EV adoption further in those countries where the cars can be sold without any tariffs.

These are not the same thing, and the fact the historically solid 2035 EU cut-off is even under review is representative of the retreat.

I'm happy to disregard anything that hasn't been confirmed though if it helps your argument, and we can just talk about the UK going backwards on their EV targets, Canada going backwards on their targets, US going backwards on their targets, and none of the optimistic EV forecasts coming true. That's problematic because it extends incentive programs or requires legislation for their extension - which, as per my previous comment, is put at risk if the goals those incentives were supposed to support haven't eventuated. The public purse isn't infinite, and the public know that even if government doesn't.



I could also add a list of every european manufacturer that has pulled back their EV production targets through the next 5-10 years, but at this point it would just be a list of the entire industry.


>but the dropping price and of EVs, and increased range and faster charging times, will also speed up the adoption of them

I don't doubt we'll continue to see adoption increase - but that's really an aside to the fact that unlike the Electrek article, the WSJ article is looking at the headwinds going forward, not sales stats from the last 9 months and saying ""past trends are representative of future trends so everything is fine"". The ""retreat"" isn't in reference to EV sales going backwards, it's in reference to the tide going out on the regulatory environment.

But your attempts to equate these articles as ""the exact opposite"" of each other is flat out wrong, because they're discussing different topics, aimed at substantially different audiences (WSJ is significantly investment and prospective performance focused, Electrek is a blog designed to be completely partial).

That's like misinformation right there! The Canadian government is reconsidering the tariff on Chinese EVs because China raised tariffs on Canadian canola oil as a response to the Canadian tariffs on Chinese EVs!

Not ""hope."" [More like actual political pressure, coming from some of the provinces in Canada where canola farmers are hurting](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/kinew-carney-canola-tariffs-prairie-pork-9.6936340).  The provinces with canola farmers want the tariffs on Chinese EVs dropped, and they are putting pressure on the federal government of Canada.

So some of the EU automakers and some EU countries putting pressure on EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen to push back the mandate counts as political pressure, but Canadian provinces trying to put pressure on the Prime Minister of Canada to lower the tariffs on Chinese EVs doesn't count as political pressure but only as ""hope"" in your view?

>So some of the EU automakers and some EU countries putting pressure on EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen to push back the mandate counts as political pressure

No, the fact that the 2035 targets have been opened for review, and a summit to review them has been called, is representative of a backing down from the previous position. It's not someone asking for a change - it's an actual review of the policy, and the review set to be completed in December.


Here - I'll spell it out since you're still struggling:

How many chargers have you added to existing buildings?

You should probably go into business and start installing chargers for big box stores.  If you’re right you’ll make a killing. 

My company operates in a few states and we have had to rework the facilities in a number of them. Many municipalities now have requirements to add chargers into lots if you redo them at all. Trenching and running new copper is expensive. Just the copper alone to power for chargers is going for more than $20/ft. Just to get the electricity from the panel (usually on the middle of the bullring), you typically have over $3k in just copper costs and other $2k in conduit and feed through for it. Then add trenching costs and the cost per foot to get it to parking spaces, usually another hundred feet or two or so for big box stores. Not to mention the breakers aren’t cheap, pulling permits, etc. 

Then you can get to start adding the chargers at a few thousand per plug after all that other cost. 

With J3400/NACS being approved there are some good options to co-use the parking lot lights to also power chargers. Those are usually a phase off a 480V line, so 277VAC — and up until last year chargers could only get certified for 208/240VAC inputs. So hopefully we will start to see chargers added onto light poles in lots to save costs. ",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o6nxup/california_reaches_291_ev_share_of_auto_sales_in/njivf5n/,2

* Car and tech spaces are dominated by men, much of the publications out there about them cater more towards men, so men are probably more comfortable researching this stuff and discussing it online. And EVs are still quite tech-adjacent.

reddit,2025-10-14T21:28:00,Empty_Wallaby5481,"My wife got transferred to a job where she'd have to commute a bit further. We had younger kids, so we both had larger vehicles to accommodate the number of kids we had.

Driving by a local dealer, I saw a PHEV for a decent price. I suggested to my wife that maybe we should look at that for the longer commute and to have an extra vehicle when the first kid could drive soon. She said to me that if we were going to get a plug in car, it should be a full electric because what's the point of getting something more complicated. 

We ended up buying a LEAF (more than 9 years ago now). Shortly after that we had our larger ICE vehicles written off in a collision (they were older, so it didn't take much). We bought another used ICE van, but a few months later, there was a good deal on a used LEAF, so we jumped on that. She ended up taking that one - she liked the colour better - despite it having an even shorter range than the first. We sold the ICE van after about 6 months of owning it to go full electric since we weren't using the van at all. 

Fast forward several years later, we upgrade one LEAF to a Bolt, bought a 1.5 gen LEAF, and kept one of the other LEAFs. Fast forward to now, we have a Tesla, Bolt, and ID4 (kids finished off the LEAFs unfortunately). 

Wife drives the ID4, but it has enough range that she has only had to fast charge once (we take my Model Y SR on trips because of Supercharging). It is supposed to have Plug and Charge at Electrify Canada sites, yet it didn't, and it took a bit to get the charger going. She absolutely hates that - I find it a problem solving adventure - and used to always take the Tesla because of that.

There are some valid concerns RE public charging stations being in sketchy locations, and I do agree with the following quote as that's been my experience with my wife.

>“If you look at the aggregate of women buyers in the United States, they tend to gravitate more towards very pragmatic purchases,” said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at the car listing and review company Edmunds. “Electric vehicles are a new technology to a lot of people. They still feel a bit unproven ... so in a lot of ways, they’re not necessarily a pragmatic buy.”

I think it's less ""these vehicles aren't being marketed to women"" and more ""many legacy brands are treating their EVs as an afterthought"".

My wife is a total Honda fangirl and she had NO idea that Honda even had an EV, let alone that it was actually a rebadged GM product. She knew she didn't want a Tesla because of Musk, she knew she didn't want a Leaf because she's been around my dad long enough to hear his complaints about his Leaf (not even really understanding that a 2012 Nissan Leaf isn't at all comparable to a 2026 Nissan Leaf), but that's really it - she's never heard of an e-tron. If it wasn't for me telling her she'd probably love one, she'd never have heard of an Ioniq 5.

reddit,2025-10-15T00:52:07,Quiet-Friendship5134,"Female EV buyer here! I got my first EV earlier this month: A 2023 Hyundai Kona Electric SE with just over 10,000 miles on the odometer. For context the cars I have driven in the past are a Honda CR-V, PT Cruiser, Honda Odyssey, and Chevy Impala. 

**What got me to buy an EV?** 

1. Very low maintenance
2. Ability to charge at home
3. Great acceleration - perfect for short on-ramps in a state with aggressive drivers!
4. Low center of gravity is great for cornering
5. Great visibility: no more minivan-style over-the-shoulder blind spot checks
6. Perfect blend of modern tech and physical buttons/knobs
7. It is gently used, which means that if it were to have a recall or major issue, it likely would have happened by now. However due to the low mileage and young age it should last for a long time.
8. A used EV is the best choice environmentally, since the battery materials were already mined and it does not emit exhaust.
9. It came with the NACS adapter so I can use the better infrastructure of the supercharging stations on longer road trips. \*I might have waited another year or two or selected a different model if it did not have the adapter\*
10. Most of my driving is around town, so there was no reason NOT to get an EV.

**What are some lingering concerns or hang-ups when doing the research to switch?**

1. Like others are saying, the safety factor of spending 15-30 minutes in a dark, secluded area to use a charger away from home is a big one. If I go on a trip outside of my range, I will go with my partner (male), my dad, or my brothers.
2. It's an adjustment that takes research. My cognitive load is already full from balancing work stuff with home stuff so the research was one thing more on an already-full plate. I actually love learning new things and over the course of many adrenaline-fueled nights I did the research that convinced me to go ahead with the purchase and then narrow down which models best fit my needs, but my sleep and work performance suffered for a couple of weeks.

I find no use in a car's ability to go a lot faster than speed limit and acceleration just needs to be fast enough to get me onto fast moving freeways/highways/motorways.

reddit,2025-10-14T20:04:13,exodist,"I own a tesla, at superchargers I have talked to a few random men about the cars to pass time. Several have told me their wives hate them for one reason: their wifes keep forgetting to plug them in when they park at home, and wake up without the charge they need. In a few cases they said their wifes were demanding they get the wife a different car, a gas one, to avoid the problem.

My own wife frequently forgets to plug hers in when she gets home, and most nights I plug it in for her when I notice.

So, these data points seem to indicate a problem where women, for whatever reason, are less likely to remember to plug in their cars at night. This is also seems to reflect a general societal bias that men should be responsible for maintenence and upkeep, maybe related?

In any case I could never see myself hating a car because I forget to plug it in. It is so useful to charge at home and not need to stop for gas!!

I am sure many men also forget to plug in, but I have never made that mistake, and I have not directly encountered any men who have.

I think this may be a data bias problem on my part. I in no way wish to say this is conclusive proof of anything, or that women have a problem or are in any way lesser.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o6pk0y/men_are_more_likely_to_buy_an_ev_why/nji7fl9/,5

Ironically, my husband has zero interest in cars and as city dwellers I am the sole owner of our single car. And yet, when at a dealership, I still get asked if I would like to come back with my husband 🙄

Outside of my anecdotal experience, I would also venture there is an element of cars being titled in the husbands name for hetero couples. To circle back to my experience, if my husband was actually a good negotiator and cared about cars, I would probably send him to the dealership to hammer out the deal! However he is not and does not and I have paid for my car out of my own funds, so he is not factored in to those purchases. Granted, we are a younger couple and my last purchase was while we were engaged but before we were married. However, I don’t see that MO changing for my next purchase.

reddit,2025-10-15T05:19:35,Trick_Figure2512,"2022 I bought my first EV vehicle. I've always liked the idea of electric vehicles because when I was a kid I had an electric rechargeable remote control car. After having the same car for 18 years that was and after the tire falling off two times I decided to get a new car. So I got my EV and my wife was happy for me. She wasn't quite on board with the EVS yet. Gas prices went up really high and she had her car that she paid for her expenses. She was complaining about how much gas was and we work two different shifts so we can technically share one car. I told her why don't you drive my car? It costs like 1/10 what it does your car to drive. It's like 2-3 ¢ a mile to drive my car. After driving my car to her job for about a year, I found her looking at EVs of the same vehicle online. I asked her what she was doing and she said she was just browsing. I asked her if she was starting to like EVS and she said yeah. She was finding it difficult to drive her gas car. We both drive the interstate to work and she likes the torque of the EV for the interstate drive. So we sold her gas car and bought her an EV. It took her driving mine for some time and opening her mind to driving EVS.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o6pk0y/men_are_more_likely_to_buy_an_ev_why/njkot5l/,1

When it comes to hobbies and who tends to have them, the computer nerds tend to be men and the car nerds also tend to be men so it shouldn’t be that surprising that a computerized car would attract a lot of men to be interested in it

reddit,2025-10-14T20:24:25,LewyDFooly,"What u/deg0ey was saying is definitely a valid possibility, and it isn’t really negated by what you mentioned. I’ll give a real-world example to show why.

Earlier this year, my girlfriend and I rented a 2023 Kia EV6 for a road trip to Orlando. We needed to stop and charge on the way, which we didn’t mind since we planned to grab food anyway.

There was a V4 Tesla Supercharger in a well-lit parking lot *right next to* our restaurant stop. But at the time, Superchargers weren’t yet open to Hyundai/Kia vehicles. So instead, the nearest CCS1 charger was a single 62 kW ChargePoint stall tucked away in a very dark RV park, about a mile from where we were supposed to be. We ended up charging slowly in a quiet, empty dirt lot.

Even though she wasn’t alone, my girlfriend was noticeably anxious. And she told me straight up that if she had been alone, she wouldn’t have felt safe stopping there at all. That experience shaped her view: before Hyundai/Kia gained Supercharger access, she had zero interest in owning an EV unless it was a Tesla.

So yeah, those “weird” charging scenarios are a real barrier for many women. Tesla’s Supercharger network tends to be in well-lit, convenient locations because it had to be for Tesla to succeed. Meanwhile, CPOs like ChargePoint haven’t had the same pressure to optimize placement, since their revenue model and operating costs are completely different.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o6pk0y/men_are_more_likely_to_buy_an_ev_why/njibiof/,64
reddit,2025-10-14T20:12:26,deg0ey,"Yeah if you know you’ll never have to charge it away from home then it’s absolutely an advantage. But many buyers *don’t* know that - either because they make the kind of drives where they *do* need to stop somewhere or because they don’t realize how good the range of EVs is these days. 

And if you think you *might* need to charge elsewhere a lot of those places feel less safe than a gas station which are generally well lit and often have staff on site so you don’t have to worry as much about being assaulted.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o6pk0y/men_are_more_likely_to_buy_an_ev_why/nji92s9/,12
reddit,2025-10-14T20:32:26,Taqah,"how easily dismissed the safety comment was. 

I don’t know if this is a substantial part of it. But, I will say that most women are going to think about safety more than  ick gasoline feelings- the environmentalist in me does notice and get upset at my exposure to fumes. I wouldn’t say I worry but the fact that I and my kid (and really anyone who lives next to a gas station or has an ice car) have to be exposed to it is awful. But this isn’t the same as “oh yucky gasoline” I don’t think I know anyone that prissy but your milieu may be very different from mine. 

Now for many women the idea of having to be at a charging station could be stressful. especially if it was at night. Sitting somewhere unsafe for 30 minutes is more risky than being somewhere unsafe for 5.  If there aren’t a lot of people at the chargers then that adds to the lack of safety.

Also, the government is not very happy that this is going to mean their emissions data requires the driver to use them a certain way or they become fucking terrible for emissions 

They aren’t really set up to charge their own battery with their own engine and if you just let it go dead electrically then you’re just hauling around a bunch of heavy electrical systems

Pure hybrids have much smaller batteries and have things set up in a way where the engine does charge the battery and the battery only assist the engine a little bit

I settled on a pure hybrid because my commute is very very short and it doesn’t matter if I’m plugging in or not but for road trips the highway mileage of the pure hybrid is just way better

It just cost too much to make it a plug-in hybrid car with a bigger battery and a whole plug-in charging system. It just makes the vehicle cost too much where it’s cheaper to just not do all of that.

In terms of risk, obviously the 260 visits to the gas station were riskier for a woman than 2 visits to the charging station. I understand my usage is the extreme end but for anyone with home charging the amount of dcfc is going be significantly lower someone without home charging. 

Obviously for people without home charging it’s a completely different situation cause you’re actually going to be charging more often and for longer than a gas car.

reddit,2025-10-14T21:11:14,oktimeforplanz,"I will ask again.

How long does fueling a car at a gas station take? How easy is it to avoid the dodgy ones?

The answers are: far less time than charging the average EV, and there are generally far more options to choose from in the vast majority of places. Whereas charging an EV means being stuck in one location for 20-30 minutes, maybe longer, in a vehicle that will not turn on until you stop the charging and unplug. I can jump into an ICE vehicle and drive away ripping the pump right off if need be. And on some routes, you may not have much, if any, choice in what chargers you use. Thus, if the only viable chargers on your route are the backarse of nowhere, you need to use them.

And this, whether you agree with it or not, makes some women decide that the risk of an EV is not worthwhile. And being lectured by a man about it is not gonna change many feelings about it, let me tell you that much.

And as a woman, who knows women... the women who have these fears tend to be the ones that WOULD need to charge their cars away from home at least some of the time, whether that's down to their travel patterns or lack of home charging.

The per kWh was higher than the EA charger 3 blocks away. Since then, the charging options have really blossomed along this route. This location I mentioned is the only gas station with an EV charger of any kind that I have noticed. 

EV chargers seem to be popping up in retail plazas, and other busy areas where people would be leaving their car for 30 minutes, or less usually. That’s just about right for some older and bigger battery EVs. But not enough time to order food, eat and wash up, plus bathroom stop. 

I think what is hard for non-EV drivers is to understand is that you don’t park to fill, hover over the gas dispenser and fiddle with the payment stuff, and then drive to a nearby place to park and eat/buy food, use the bathroom routine. 

In an EV one parks, plugs in, walks to nearby restaurant/snack shack, and maybe rests for a bit, like maybe 10 minutes, returns to car and leaves. The hovering and re-parking go away. 
I’ll agree that the lack of EV chargers on traditionally longer routes and the waiting times can get annoying and become inconvenient. Over time these issues can be remedied.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o6lq2b/why_havent_gas_stations_added_ev_charging/njhl9cu/,1

Almost all new 'quick mart' type places (regardless of if they sell gas) that have gone up around me have been built with EV chargers. Mainly fast chargers but also some with level 2.

That said, my state offers a TON of incentive to make this happen. Our energy provider does as well.  So long as the power is available near by, there is zero up-front or long-term cost to the business to make something like this happen.

They energy provider will run the necessary lines for free, and there are plenty of state funded/private charging networks who will come install, and maintain, chargers for no cost. You just need to approve the location and maintain the parking area.

It's such a popular program that there's no guaranteeing you will get chosen as a location at all. One quick service place near us was built a few years back with a side parking lot near electrical lines. It was clearly done to act as a charging location... but remained empty for years. They recently got  approved by Tesla for a 8 (12) bay super charging location. 

FWIW - I work in a very rural part of the state. There is zero charging anywhere near me. The company I work for has had this on their list of proposed projects for some time now. I know for a fact that it can be done for zero cost to us...but the chargers would need to remain open to the public. We don't sell anything here and inviting people onto the property who might ask to use the bathroom, litter, hang around after hours, etc. is a tough sell. Which I get.

1. Most are not in a good location for DC fast charging but set up for people to hit on their way home from work.

2.  They lack the power needs at the site. Gas stations take relatively little power to run. DC fast charging requires a lot of power.  350kw of power for a single DC unit is more than a 10x jump over what they currently use. No way to do it.

3. DC fast changing is a different setup. YOu need to be in a way to expect people to want to be there for 30-40 mins.  

4. DC fast charing more need on road trips hence item 3 needs being different but does not address item 2 issues. 

  
Remember in EV people do not charge locally but only really on trips. Gas stations for the most part are set up to meet local needs and in the true in and out in 5 mins.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o6lq2b/why_havent_gas_stations_added_ev_charging/njhpp20/,1

reddit,2025-10-14T18:47:20,AceOfFL,"Because retrofitting charging takes additional space and money and because cars run on gasoline.

Charge points cannot be built next to gasoline pumps. There must be additional available space for charge points that is not over the large underground gasoline tanks. Also, the installation of chargers is costly. (Not as costly as a gas station but they must be outfitted for maximum charging output even if that will be used only a fraction of the time. Utilities aren't cheap for this type of installation and the charger incentives are now gone as you may have heard?)

As of mid-2025, the number of BEVs on U.S. roads is estimated to be around 1.4% of the total vehicle fleet. Today, cars still run primarily on gasoline.
As the market share of new BEVs continues to rise, the percentage will increase enough that it will make sense to add chargers to gas stations. In the meantime, Walmart and Tesla are still adding chargers and GM had partnered with Pilot and there are other companies building charging stations.

I think you kind of described the situation though, most likely.  Those gas stations must look at things as profit per square foot, and so you want quick fill ups, quick purchase, and go.  For them to stay longer, you'd start wanting food and seating, and then you arrive at the fact that land owners likely do, ""Why not build a restaurant with some EV chargers?""  I say that anecdotally, because it's quite normal, even in North Carolina, to see restaurants with EV charging spots.

Also, if direct charging becomes more popular, their time at the ""pump"" would be similar to a gas fill up, so maybe that will become the thing that brings them in.

For ICE, you're going to stay at the gas station for only 5 minutes. If there's a queue (like when gas is cheap), you just have to wait maybe an additional 5 minutes. Gas stations have evolved to serve this perfectly.

For EVs, you'll be spending 30-45 minutes charging at L3. If the gas station has only 2 charging stalls and they're all being used, you'll have to wait 15-20 minutes for others to finish before you start your 30-45 min charge. To shorten the queue time, they can add more chargers, which needs more electrical infrastructure. To get the queue time to practically 0 minutes (when one car is done and the next car rolls in), they need to have something like 10+ stalls. Too many for a local gas station.

1) You need a beef electrical connection and supply.  
2) Many states prohibit a sale-for-resale model without added value since utilities have a regulated monopoly, but some private sector folks are figuring out ways to circumvent this prohibition. Selling at their cost doesn't make sense, but it would draw customers in since it would be cheaper than residential rates.  
3) Home or at your destination charging is more attractive given the time it takes to charge. Even with fast charging, charging takes most of an hour, so until customers have other distractions at a service station to make going there worth the time, the business model may not be viable.  
4) Some of the ones that are doing this are crazy expensive because they had to pay for the electrical infrastructure. For a 10-position or greater station, due to the charging duration, the sweet spot requires an electrical interconnection at sub-transmission (69kV) or transmission voltage (>100kV), step-down transformers, breakers, etc., which could easily cost upwards of $1M.

reddit,2025-10-14T18:10:58,spinfire,"Currently cars on the market have a wide variety of charge times. A typical stop for me is 10-15 minutes. A Tesla Model 3 might be spending 25 minutes. A first gen BZ4X or Bolt is gonna be spending 45+ minutes. Those are big differences! What you're used to is really going to guide whether this question makes sense.

Someone else who has responded to you says they should have restaurants and shopping complexes to ""kill time"". But for me a charge stop is just the amount of time it takes to run into the gas station building and go to the bathroom and grab a coffee. The idea of trying to find a bathroom in a ""shopping complex"" or sitting down for a full meal is never what I'm looking for. A shopping complex is the kind of stop I actively avoid in planning because they're such a pain and frequently there are no bathrooms available after a shockingly early hour of the night.

So some charge stops should have amenities suitable for longer dwell time but some should be just like gas stations.

Almost nobody in the world has a gas station in their garage. So every single gas car on the planet has to fill up at a gas station any time they need gas. 

Every single EV owner (that has a garage anyway) can charge at home every day. EV owners in general don’t need to charge outside of their house unless they are on a road trip. 

So most gas stations don’t need to add chargers at all. If every gas station added a charger for every pump, they would have far too many chargers and wouldn’t empty most of the time. 

If the world started with EV’s instead of gas cars, I don’t think “charging stations” would exist at all in the same way gas stations do.

reddit,2025-10-14T19:50:42,KeanEngineering,"They're banking on a slow rollout of more EVs, and I don't blame them. EVs in general have less range than ICEs. That, on its own, one would think, ""hey, let's put MORE charging stations up and get more business."" This magical thinking can and will backfire by having the cart before the horse. The reality is, many reluctant EV owners still believe in range anxiety and will use their second car (ICE) to go on long trips. And when it's not a Tesla (w/FSD), there are even more reasons NOT to go on long trips in an EV. If the gas station owners, franchisees, or petroleum companies were to flip the narrative and see that there's business in those hills (like you alluded to), then they might decide to invest. But you need hard numbers. Again, as I said, that is not reality.

Gas is a known quantity, in terms of volume and turnover. So most businesses always bet on a sure thing (the past). This will be the case even in the near future as EVs will be getting newer battery technology next year making the growth of charging stations less viable as an investment. Just this week Nissan introduced their new generation Leaf touting a 702 km (436-mile) range. It's only going to increase (600 - 800 mile ranges are not out of the question in the next 5 years) from here on end so current EVs (with their limited range) will soon become a footnote in history.

Certain pundits claim that the transportation industry in general will have a huge shift in the next 20-30 years and I tend to agree. So, why would a gas station owner want to dive whole hog into an uncertain future? Can they make the same (or more) money delivering kWh versus pumping gas for the same turnover NOW? Clearly, that would be a no. So, as much as I would like to see a business model that we've had for almost 10 decades continue, it's probably time to let it go.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o6lq2b/why_havent_gas_stations_added_ev_charging/nji4q0c/,2

reddit,2025-10-14T18:08:05,ScuffedBalata,"Investment return, risk profiles, etc.

A gas chain that does this at 200 locations is literally taking a $100m gamble, likely using borrowed money.  If it doesn't pay off (say, the hardware turns out to be unreliable, or something shifts in the EV market, or their particular choice of location isn't good) they could lose ENORMOUS money over it.

It's also a business model they're unfamiliar with because costs are driven by electricity availability and contracts with local power companies and things, rather than their typical supply chain of gas tankers and refineries, etc.

It's a gamble they may not want to take.  Other companies might choose differently.

For my opinion, I think the typical choices about where to situation gas stations isn't actually the same as what we'll eventually settle on for EV charging, unless EV charging gets down under 5 minutes in the future.

If I had no home charging, and there were my chosen moderately fast chargers at grocery stores, I'd be way more likely to use them.  It's the one and only type of building I go to for 20-30 minutes several times per week.

For road trips, I want chargers DIRECTLY at the interstate exits, however, not at some shop up the street, so there's two different use cases.

If I am in my EV it is maybe me stopping in for a red bull and candy on my way to work or it is me filling up my ICE car on a different day. A quick 5 min from engine off to engine on.

Road trip is just a different use case and for DC fast charging a much larger use case.

The Ford F-150 has been the best selling vehicle in the US for 47 years in a row and counting. The Chevy Silverado/GMC Sierra and Dodge Ram are always close behind and still in the top 5. Big trucks are BY FAR the best selling vehicles in America, for around 50 years in a row and counting. 

The reason electric trucks aren't selling that well is because 
1: They cost an arm and a leg.  
2: Most of them don't have enough range.  
3: They are all crew cabs.  
4: None of them can handle a 5th wheel or a cabover camper.  

There are little nuances that bend these statements - like the Silverado EV has enough range but it has a weird bed shape that standard shells won't fit and it costs around $100K. The F-150 Lightning has a standard bed that a lot of shells are available for, but doesn't have the range to go on a far away camping trip without spending half the time (hyperbole) charging. 

Basically, the EV trucks on the market right now targeted one specific type of user. Everyone on reddit said, ""Nobody uses their truck as a truck anyway. They only get used for driving to the grocery store with the kids in the back seat."" And apparently the auto execs bought into that nonsense. So all the EV trucks are perfectly designed for that use case. Everyone that wants an EV and uses a truck for that purpose is who they are being marketed to. 

People who want to pull a 5th wheel from coast to coast, or want to be able to use their cabover camper that they spent $20K on and currently use with their diesel truck, or they don't drive kids to the grocery store in their truck and they just want an extended cab and not a full crew cab, etc, etc. Those people don't have an option right now. It's not that they don't want an electric truck, it's that none of the electric trucks on the market can do these things. And if you're going to fork out around $100K for a truck, you don't want to have any compromises. Especially if you already have a diesel truck that does all of this and you spent $80K on a 5th wheel trailer that you use regularly.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o6hest/it_turns_out_that_americans_dont_really_want_big/njgu3n2/,8

reddit,2025-10-14T15:36:08,tech57,"Ford’s F-150 Lightning Is Winning The Electric Pickup Game. Rivian’s R1T? Not So Much  
https://insideevs.com/news/775704/electric-pickup-sales-us-q3-2025/  
> Despite the Tesla Cybertruck’s huge sales drop in Q3, the Rivian R1T finished dead last.   
> 
> The best-selling electric truck in America in the third quarter was the Ford F-150 Lightning, with 10,005 units sold, a healthy 39.7% year-over-year increase. From the beginning of the year, the blue oval automaker sold 23,024 Lightnings stateside, according to Cox Automotive, a modest 1% increase over last year.
> 
> The Tesla Cybertruck finished the quarter in second place, with 5,385 units sold, a dramatic 62.2% drop year-over-year. From January through September, Tesla sold 16,097 Cybertrucks, a 38% decrease compared to the same period last year.
> 
> Hot on the heels of the controversial angular pickup is the GMC Hummer EV. Granted, we don’t know for sure how many pickup models were sold, as Cox Automotive’s data bundles pickups and SUVs. Together, the two electric behemoths sold 5,246 units in the previous quarter, an increase of 21.9% over last year. From the beginning of the year, 13,233 units found new homes, a 48.7% increase over 2024.
> 
> Fourth place goes to the Chevrolet Silverado EV, which nearly doubled its sales numbers compared to last year. In Q3, the Silverado EV sold 3,940 units, up 97.5% year-over-year. From January to September, 9,370 trucks were sold, a 78.6% increase from last year.
> 
> The technically similar GMC Sierra EV is close behind, with 3,374 units finding new customers in the third quarter. The Sierra EV had a late start last year, which means its sales increased by a whopping 771.8% in Q3 2025. Year-to-date, 6,147 units were sold.
> 
> The Rivian R1T is currently the worst-selling electric pickup in America. In the previous quarter, the EV startup sold 2,378 pickups, a decent increase of 13.1% over last year, but it wasn’t enough to help it get ahead of any of its competitors. The same goes for the R1T’s year-to-date sales performance, with 5,857 EVs finding new homes, a decrease of 32.5% versus last year, when Rivian sold 8,673 R1Ts from January through September.

I’m guessing that Ford is going to come out with a plug in hybrid based on the 2.7L ecoboost (or possibly a small diesel) with a 50-100kwh pack that will answer a lot of people’s prayers for more efficiency towing. The current 3.5L powerboost non-plug in hybrid is okay but doesn’t get great mileage towing and has a smaller gas tank on the light duty frame, and thus has smallish payload.

Then there's the fact that charging stations aren't setup very conveniently for towing or hauling.

I had range anxiety m about taking it Hunting. About 200 miles each way in November limited charging at deer camp. And finally lease price. The lease price would have been way more. I understand recently they have come down and it would have been competitive but that was not the case when I was looking. There are things ICE does better. Long trips and towing.

reddit,2025-10-14T22:06:31,jph200,"Well yeah, because people don’t want to deal with the reduced range when towing.  Finding chargers may be a headache depending on where you’re at, chargers are often difficult to access with a trailer connected, and it takes too long to charge which is a turn-off since you’d be doing it more often than you would without a trailer.

I understand towing has an impact on gas mileage on ICE vehicles as well, but it’s a lot easier to find a gas station and it’s easier to park at a gas pump when a trailer is attached.

I’m sure this type of use case and situation will be better in the future it’s not great right now.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o6hest/it_turns_out_that_americans_dont_really_want_big/njiuzd1/,1

reddit,2025-10-14T17:56:53,toomuch3D,"Summer of 2024 I was driving south on the German Autobahn 5. It was fun to once in a while hitting over 200kmh. But, I noticed lots of sedans and station wagons. About 1/4 were towing small trailers/campers at lower speeds, but those were piled high and generally heavily secured and covered, plus signage, etc. 
I saw a handful of US made pickup trucks my entire trip. Usually with business logos on them and machines attached to the beds or filled beds. Before I got my Rivian, I was considering a sedan and a small trailer for dump runs, hauling stuff around, and the regional trips we do. The reason for getting a 7 seater is family trips, secured surfboards out of the sun and out of site, bikes, dogs, hauling, camping and ski trips, plus naps after surfing with hatch open (self leveling is great). I wouldn’t recommend it to just anyone, but the flexibility and comfort I really appreciate. 
I don’t tow yet with it, as I haven’t had a major reason to yet, but even if I had to charge often to tow in trips, like every 150 miles, I’d also have to use the toilet (more likely the wife and dogs need a bladder break), or need a snack/meal, so I could easily make that work.

The fullsize truck market is traditional and fleet sales are huge. they count on cost per mile/operating costs as well as stripped down model pricing.  Consumers are loyalists to diesel for towing and gas for the range and more trips to the gas station but they are everywhere.

People don't understand the strategy.  Ford played it smart. They saved a ton of money by using the existing F150. Under the market forces at the time, they developed a legit fantastic ev pickup quickly.  They have years of ev experience now.  

Ford is developing a new EV platform and the first vehicle is a compact pickup starting at $30k.  Ford knows it's a great strategy because the Maverick hybrid is selling insanely well.

reddit,2025-10-14T16:14:12,Ithirahad,"Right, but the market for an EV pickup truck is people who *actually need a pickup* (and don't need huge towing/hauling range). Very few of those individuals have any need for so-called ""full size"".

Most of the full-size trucks are either self-medication for unmitigated anxiety and insecurity, or identity statements, or both - and being electric (meaning, dependent on new tech and associated with ""green"" politics) completely undermines both of those purposes.

...And many of those few who genuinely need the full-sized pickup, are towing or hauling huge things sometimes hours away and cannot afford to be kneecapped by electric range limitations.

After you trim all of those people off, who is left? A very small contingent of actual pickup-users willing to put up with an oversized vehicle for the lower operating costs and environmental footprint, and an already small, actively shrinking population of right-leaning techbros who aren't actively hostile to the planet they live on, do want to drive a truck for image or percieved utility reasons, and yet somehow don't want a Cybertruck.

If the driver is being paid to go to the gas station then that cost go a away, as does the wear and tear on the vehicle.

Protect job via tariff is a dead end. You are limit your customer to domestic population who is trapped in a prison with you. Which by the way has dwindling population so your customer base is shrinking while your product grow less and less competitive in the international market. By the domestic customer can no longer support expensive inferior quality product. The outside world has advance so much, the domestic industry can no longer compete and have no time to catch up.

The better way is through subsidy, so both domestic buyer and foreign buyer have incentive to buy your product. And you are actually gaining international market share instead of sticking your head in the sand and hope domestic buyer will support over price inferior product forever. Not to mention subsidy draw from progressive tax pool which have less burden on the middle class compare tariff which punish middle and lower class more severely but it's regressive taxing scheme and lower/middle class spend greater portion of their income on consumption compare to upper class.

I'm not suggesting domestic dont need help. But help them through tariff is the wrong way and more harmful to the middle class compare to the subsidy route.

In more rural areas with no charging infrastructure and long drives, frequently towing real loads, a gas truck is going to be necessary until hydrogen becomes more popular or electric trucks improve quite a bit on towing range for the money. No dispute here on that.

Where I get frustrated is with the city and suburban people I am exposed to much more day to day. Of the truck owners who fit into that category who I’ve been exposed to, the comment I made applies to nearly all of them. People who don’t tow or utilize the bed for anything that couldn’t fit in the back of an SUV more than twice a year, who don’t go off road anywhere an AWD electric SUV couldn’t go, who don’t leave an 80 mile radius for than a handful of times a year, mostly places they’d travel by plane anyways.

The SC01 is badass, but cute and fun will do.

Those should already be nearly ideal shapes for EVs because they are all streamlined teardrops. 

They say early car designers feared that all cars would eventually become identical because the use of smoke tunnel simulations showed that there were ideal shapes that were more aerodynamic than others. Many of those highly aerodynamic designs are still there to borrow from. It's an airfoil, a teardrop. Within that, you can play around. . fenders? How much canopy is necessary?

This is especially true for EVs, since their brakes are already oversized compared to their non-EV counterparts and the single-speed transmissions in many EVs are more robust than traditional automatic gearboxes. Most (all?) modern EV motors have power to spare for towing.

You can overload a trailer on a vehicle that's rated for towing just as easily as one that's not. It's all about common sense no matter what you're driving or hauling. Low speed, local towing is going to be fine for everything but the smallest, most underpowered ICEVs and being rated for towing doesn't matter in most (reasonable) cases.

And a lot of suburban Americans doesn't care about car size, so the length doesn't matter either.  The rear seats are very large, so if rear passengers are only using it occasionally, it's okay to have coupe doors.  I've found this out with my Fiat; having no rear doors isn't as bad as you think.  The liftback trunk is also excellent for cargo.  ",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o72x47/dodges_charger_daytona_ev_is_the_enemy_of/njkxf6u/,6

reddit,2025-10-15T02:45:03,ApprehensiveSize7662,"GAC, a Chinese automotive giant, has officially announced its arrival in Australia, with the arrival of the Aion V electric SUV and two other vehicles, the M8 PHEV people mover and emzoom ICE SUV.

GAC, an acronym for Guangzhou Automobile Group Co, it is one of the largest automakers in China and has multiple EV models in its line up in other global markets, some of which could follow the Aion V into the Australian market.

The company also has multiple R&D facilities and design centres in Guangzhou, Milan, Los Angeles and Shanghai, and last year opened a factory in Thailand, its first outside of China. In 2024, it produced over 2 million vehicles.

We expect the local pricing of the GAC Aion V to start under $45,000, although full details will not be announced until November.

“Launching GAC in Australia is an exceptional milestone for our brand,” said Cheney Liang, the deputy general manager of GAC Australia.

“I have no doubt that Australian customers will welcome our range of high-quality, innovative models with keen interest, and become accustomed to the elevated ownership experience we are set to offer”.

According to the approval documentation, the Aion V will enter Australia with some key high level specs. It is 4.6 metres long and has a tare weight of 1,880 kg, making it one of the lighter electric SUVs on the market.

Powering the Aion V is a 150 kW motor, which is fed by a 75 kWh lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery pack. This setup can deliver up to 602 km of NEDC, which is likely closer to 480 km on the WLTP cycle.

The relatively large battery can be fast charged at speeds of up to 180 kW. With this speed, the Aion V can be fast-charged from 30-80% in 16 minutes, according to specs found in other markets.

The powertrain can also help the car get from 0-100 km/h in 7.9 seconds, thanks to 240 Nm of torque. On colours, 6 different options are available in Thailand, including orange and gold.

The Aion V will come with 19-inch alloy wheels.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o6zilq/gac_officially_announces_its_entry_into/njk4s79/,3

reddit,2025-10-14T19:29:32,Chicoutimi,"Tesla's going to continue to do fairly well in individual EV model sales charts for the near future. They make competitive EVs with limited cannibalization of sales from its own vehicles as it sells only two model types in most markets, and currently five at the most within its home market. This is in contrast to most other automakers which greatly diversify their offerings across many different, but often overlapping segments.

This has meant that each of those other automakers will spread their sales among many more models and even brands than Tesla which has resulted in lower placements in individual model sales even for vehicles that are competitive in their segments than had they had a much more limited number of individual models, but ultimately also means it's likely that these automotive groups will continue to grow more rapidly in total market share by automotive group.

YTD sales volume through September 2025 is actually down by over 10% compared to the same period last year when their annual record was set. The fact that both market share and sales volume are decreasing simultaneously shows they are losing ground to local competitors.

Even if Tesla's sales volume were slightly up, China's overall EV market is exploding. Tesla's sales volume can rise, but if the local competition BYD, Li Auto, Nio, Xiaomi, etc. is growing their sales volume much faster, Tesla's market share will still decrease.

>The Monday after last Thanksgiving in 2019, Mary Barra, chief executive officer of General Motors Co., announced the automaker’s biggest layoff since its 2009 bankruptcy. Five North American factories were marked for closure. Six thousand hourly jobs in the U.S. and Canada would soon be eliminated, and about 18,000 salaried employees would have until the end of the year to consider a buyout package. GM needed more than a third of the salaried personnel to accept. Fewer than 2,000 did. The remainder would have to be let go, which they were, starting in February.

>On March 5, a couple thousand survivors crowded into the atrium of GM’s engineering center in suburban Detroit to hear Barra explain the overhaul at a town hall meeting. Thousands more tuned in via webcast. Barra, a GM lifer who’s been through plenty of similar moments as both boss and underling, told her audience the company is undergoing a wrenching but necessary transition. GM, she said, could no longer invest in slow-selling sedans and small cars or in far-flung markets that weren’t delivering significant profits. ***That money had to be plowed into electric vehicles and self-driving cars, which she described as the foundation of the company’s future***. “We need to seize this opportunity,” she told the silent crowd. “Make no mistake, we are not here just to compete in this new world … we are here to win.”

From what I can tell, this ""Software Defined Vehicle"" thing means a few things, but the big ones are moving all the firmware to fewer CPUs in fewer places around the car, being able to update it online, and having more software and software features, of course. Being the cynical engineer I am I'd also like to just have CarPlay and some basic L2 ADAS features, though a Tesla-style integrated dashcam does sound nice. I'm just not really interested in talking to computers, getting data collected or paying for subscriptions.

On a positive note moving software into fewer modules does have some real benefits to cost, reliability and repairability. It makes more sense than having third-party firmware running on a sea of third-party modules strewn about the vehicle. I wonder how hard automakers will try to actually push it forward, though?

reddit,2025-10-14T05:46:42,ApprehensiveSize7662," There’s a comforting story that oil bulls like to tell themselves to stave off worries about the future: While the privileged few in Europe and California might have lost their minds over electric vehicles, billions of drivers in the Global South are readying themselves to provide the next wave of petroleum demand.
 
Those who believe this might want to have a look at the cars and two-wheelers that people are actually buying right now. Far from trailing the rich world in their enthusiasm for battery cars, developing nations are surging ahead.
 
China (where plug-in vehicles have nearly half the market) gets most of the attention, but neighboring Vietnam isn’t far behind: Pure-play EV-maker VinFast Auto Ltd. accounted for more than a third of car sales in the first half of this year. Turkey’s 13 per cent sales share for fully electric vehicles in the first quarter was about double the penetration rate in Spain and Australia, according to a survey by Strategy&. In Indonesia, the share was about the same as in the US, at 7.4 per cent. In Malaysia, it was 8.6 per cent in the first half.
 
charts
 
 
Those countries all have legacy car industries still pumping out internal combustion engines. Things are moving even faster in nations wholly dependent on imports. More than three-quarters of the value of vehicles brought into Nepal, Sri Lanka and Djibouti last year was purely electric. Import shares in Ethiopia and Laos were 40 per cent and 30 per cent respectively. Plug-in sales increased by 60 per cent in developing countries as a whole in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

 As with the wave of EVs taking over the Gulf’s oil producers, it’s a sign of a world switching to electric mobility with breathtaking speed. The pace of the change makes the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which expects developing economies’ oil consumption to increase by half by 2050, look deluded. 
 
It’s not impossible this rapid electrification will slow down. EV buyers in emerging markets over the past few years have been encouraged by a range of exemptions from import tariffs, licenses and sales taxes. These subsidies may be removed as local markets mature.
 
charts
 
That’s a thin reed on which to base hopes of a gasoline resurgence, though. In major emerging markets, battery cars were already around price parity with conventional ones last year (in Thailand, they were cheaper). Falling battery costs and rising volumes have since driven down the price of market-leading Chinese EVs by another 10 per cent, while a weaker US dollar has improved purchasing power in many countries.
 
Combined with the lower ownership costs of EVs — a major consideration in emerging markets, where a larger share of vehicles are used as taxis and to transport goods, rather than as private cars — that’s likely to keep battery automobiles competitive with conventional ones, even without government support.
 
Policymakers are also likely to extend such incentives for purely macroeconomic reasons. In India and Pakistan, oil and gas account for as much as a third of the total import bill, compared to around 10 per cent in the US and European Union. That makes the economy unusually vulnerable to swings in the price of crude, and ensures that money spent on transport fuel is enriching other countries, rather than being recycled through domestic supply chains where it can enhance economic growth. Switching half of India’s car fleet to electricity — still a far-off ambition, to be sure — would be sufficient to eliminate the country’s persistent current account deficit, according to one 2022 study.
 
charts
 
Conventional cars will still be guzzling gas for years after they disappear from dealers’ lots. BloombergNEF doesn’t expect the fleet of plug-free cars to peak until 2028. That will provide an ongoing market for gasoline and diesel — but it’s still a declining one. By 2030, BloombergNEF forecasts EVs will be displacing about 5.3 million barrels of oil a day, equivalent to about a 10th of all road fuel consumed globally at present.
 
The stronger argument for the resilience of road fuel at this point isn’t that emerging markets are going to start using more of it. It’s clear this battle is already being lost. Instead, it’s that rich countries have raised tariff barriers, bungled charger rollouts, and loosened fuel-economy rules to the point where they’ve sabotaged their own transition plans. 
 
That’s giving incumbent carmakers a chance to eke a few more years out of their obsolete businesses, while competitors in the Global South seize the technological lead. Most of the world is already taking advantage of cleaner, cheaper road transportation. By the time developed countries realize how far they’ve fallen behind, it will be too late to catch up.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o67c7a/ev_adoption_surges_in_developing_nations/njejkoj/,40

https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-2025

Current oil consumption is ~101 mb/d.  it will continue to grow, but at a slower rate than previously.

“Global oil demand is forecast to rise by 2.5 mb/d from 2024 to 2030, reaching a plateau around 105.5 mb/d by the end of the decade. However, annual growth slows from roughly 700 kb/d in 2025 and 2026 to just a trickle over the next several years, with a small decline expected in 2030, based on today’s policy settings and market trends. This is driven by below-trend economic growth, weighed down by global trade tensions and fiscal imbalances, and the accelerating substitution away from oil in the transport and power generation sectors.

Despite some recent headwinds, global electric car sales have continued their remarkable growth trajectory. They exceeded 17 million in 2024 and are expected to surpass 20 million in 2025, representing around one-quarter of all cars sold, according to the IEA’s Global Electric Vehicle Outlook 2025. This analysis shows that EVs are set to displace 5.4 mb/d of global oil demand by the end of the decade. Substitution away from oil will also feature prominently in power generation during the forecast period – particularly in Saudi Arabia, where displacement of oil burning by natural gas and renewables drives the single largest decline in oil demand for any country through 2030.”

75% of vehicles sold in 2025 worldwide will be ICE powered.  So no, EVs will not cause oil to disappear.  IEA’ projection shows EVs removing 5% of current oil demand.",https://reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1o67c7a/ev_adoption_surges_in_developing_nations/njez5u5/,-1

So, in simple terms, there’s 5% less oil being produced every year.  Unless there continuing investment to sustain that production or develop new reserves, supply falls.  

In simple terms, if demand falls at the same rate as supply falls, the price stays the same.  If there’s a slight mismatch (there always is, which is why the price of oil fluctuates), the price falls if too much supply and rises if there’s too much demand.  

So, there won’t be a $30 scenario, because producers won’t invest the money to keep production at that level.  Fields with high production costs get temporarily shut in when the price gets too low.

There will be a time when physical production declines substantially.  It’s been forecast since the 1950s.  But the takeaway point is that oil will be with us for many decades to come.

I used to think the same, but the last few I've dealt with haven't had the wire limiter. I think they've stopped using it due to EU bullshit reasons, even on controllers that use QS-S4/TF100 dashboards.

However, I concede that I wrote that part of the page in an excessively exclusive way. I intended for it to dissuade noobs from opening their lid and getting all the ratnest out looking for a wire that doesn't exist, but that's no excuse for factual inaccuracy so I'll be correcting it.

See what I meant about constantly finding stuff to fix? :D

>  there is a non-regenrative way to do it by shorting the phase wires together

Shorting the wires together will cause braking - actually a whole lot of it - but isn't doable long-term because it follows the same principles: the motor is still running as a generator, only the energy it's producing is being kept in the motor itself as heat. Keep it shorted on a downhill and you'll cook the windings *very* rapidly.

> I'm almost certain my Laotie L6 uses this method, as no amount of braking even in extremely steep hills ever increases the voltage reading

I can tell you my L6 Pro does do ""regen"" because the hardware voltmeter - when it still had it, before the Big Rewiring - did actually jump up when e-braking. I haven't tested with the meter in the dashboard yet, but I think it has a much lower refresh rate.

I'd be *extremely* surprised if your L6 didn't do the same.

>  there is a noticeable delay between pulling the lever and it actually starting - time it needs to wait to make sure the drive is first disconnected.

Mine does the same and I find it so irritating I'm considering adding switches to the brake levers so I can disable e-braking for conditions when the delay is unacceptable, like offroading.

The weird part is, I can hear the motor drive whine doing *something* before it engages the brake: in-between pulling the brake and it actually engaging the motor generator there's about a second when it does a strange buzz - so it's not just an arbitrary delay added in firmware.

At a mildly educated guess I think it's due to the dumb sensorless nature of the controllers - I'd wager they need some time to figure out where the rotor is by reading coil EMF. But then I have a controller that's just as dumb and sensorless in my Speedway Mini4Pro and the delay - while present - is much shorter.

Maybe we just have shit controllers :D I'd almost be tempted to swap them out for smart sensorless/sinewave ones, or even biting the bullet and getting a dual VESC setup, if it didn't mean redoing all the wiring once again, and I just don't have that sort of patience at the moment.

I might actually bother the Endless Sphere people to get an answer to this, as it's been puzzling me for a while.

> on a big enough motor the current induced would be enough to just instantly lock it and throw the rider off the scooter.

A dead short would do this on any scooter. I know because it happened to me on my old ES2 - before I reinforced the controller I managed to blow the traces while braking, the MOSFETs stuck shorted and the sudden wheel-lock would have caused a good tumble if I hadn't been prepared to jump off. Considering how much lower-powered the ES2 motor is compared to the L6, that's another reason I'm 99% sure your L6 doesn't dead-short the motor for braking.",https://reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/1f8x0at/we_have_a_wiki_also_derestriction_threads_are_no/llljoxr/,2

> It works on low powered motors to just increase resistance greatly - on a big enough motor the current induced would be enough to just instantly lock it and throw the rider off the scooter.

That WOULD be non-regenerative (the braking load becomes the stator resistance and all the energy appears in the stator which incidentally is going to get hot really fast and start smoking), but with a dead short characteristic current will flow and on pretty well any scooter direct drive motor, that will be a violent torque and just seize up brutally. If the drive tire is in the rear it will skid and you will fish and jackknife all over the road. In the front, it will probably turn the scooter into a rider catapult (one reason I am not a huge fan of FWD, if you ever have an inverter kaboom and it turns into a short circuit, or there is a bug/oversight and it freaks in a way that involves driving out a constant zero vector, you could get launched).

If you were to address this by PWMing between the low-impedance zero vector (all highsides OR all lowsides ON at once) and a high-impedance state (all devices OFF at once), it becomes regenerative, because the antiparallel diodes become the only possible current decay path during the off-time for the currents building up in the stator during the on-time and rectify that current back into the DC bus. This is exactly how the ""special case braking modulation"" works in SimonK (and most if not all other such stone age gear used to this day in hobby, robot, tool, drone and RC things).",https://reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/1f8x0at/we_have_a_wiki_also_derestriction_threads_are_no/llvys8r/,2

As you can see in my video, it doesn't. It's still easy to turn by hand with the windings shorted, so when you have 100kg of scooter and human on top it has no chance. Granted that example is using a smaller 350w rated motor, but the principle is the same with the L6 - I've tested it.


Also another reason I'm fairly sure it doesn't do regen is that I live on top of a rather steep hill, and the brake isn't any weaker even if I have a full battery or not.

Can confirm - had a controller kaboom on a lowly Ninebot ESx, shorted FETs due to e-braking spike burning off the traces.

The folding mechanism is garbage and MANY people in this sub complain about that latch failing on them, sometimes while they're fuckin riding it. Plus the entire scooter folds at the top of the deck which means that could be a weak point, ESPECIALLY if it's a cheap scooter. That's the kind of thing to REALLY fuck your face and your day, all the way up when it breaks. 

Honestly bro, I'd say stick with the tried and tested brands. It's nice to save money and all, but at what cost in the long run if it just breaks on you, and if it's a generic parts bin scooter, you will be extremely likely to find yourself hanging with the warranty claim.

reddit,2025-10-15T04:13:03,pyrotechnicmonkey,"This is somewhat true, because typically there will be a good bit of headroom in what the motor can actually run at based on the power it receives from the controller and the battery. However, you’re still limited by the voltage output of the battery so I think even if you change the controller, you’re not really gonna get that much amperage output so I doubt you would really see any sort of improvement. 
Plus these days motors don’t quite have as much headroom as they used to. Nowadays, they are built a little bit closer to the battery and controller They are paired with. This was more frequent several years ago when battery tech and controllers hadn’t been as developed and couldn’t deliver as much power.",https://reddit.com/r/ElectricScooters/comments/1o70tew/go_faster_custom_build_guidance/njkgzpk/,3
