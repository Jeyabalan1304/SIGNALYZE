Ather Sentiment Analysis System

An end-to-end sentiment and feedback mining project built to understand public opinion on the **Ather Rizta** electric scooter. This project combines web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and data visualization to uncover actionable insights from community discussions on **Reddit** and **YouTube**.

---

##  Project Overview

This system automates the full analytics pipeline — from gathering user-generated content to performing multi-level sentiment and feedback categorization. It identifies public perception, recurring themes, and improvement areas for the Ather Rizta EV.

**Core Functions:**
- Automated data collection from Reddit & YouTube
- Sentiment classification into Positive, Negative, and Neutral
- Three-level hierarchical categorization for detailed insight mapping
- Statistical and visual analysis of sentiment trends
- Data cleaning, normalization, and duplicate removal

##  Deliverables

1. **Clean Processed Dataset**  
   CSV file containing all comments, metadata, sentiment scores, and hierarchical category tags.  
   → Output location: `results/rizta_sentiment_analysis_final.csv`

2. **Insight Report**  
   A two-page summary highlighting major findings — top praises, critical issues, and the analytical methodology used.  
   → Output: `results/ather_rizta_summary_report.pdf`

3. **Source Code & Dependencies**  
   All scripts for scraping, analysis, and visualization, along with a `requirements.txt` for reproducibility.
